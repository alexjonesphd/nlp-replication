Action Dynamics Reveal Parallel
Competition in Decision Making

When deciding between two alternatives, such as whether to
order the pasta or the chicken, or whether to pursue a career in
academia or industry, a person may feel torn—as if the options
literally pull him or her in two directions. This metaphor may
have some surprising literal truth. If asked, for example, whether
‘‘murder is sometimes justiﬁed,’’ individuals may be inclined to
both agree and disagree with the statement. Here, we document,
for the ﬁrst time, the pull toward contrasting responses during
evaluative thinking, reporting the results of a study examining
the trajectory of participants’ reaching movements toward different response options.
Our results suggest that a decision process is not necessarily
completed in the brain’s cognitive subsystems before it is shared
with other subsystems, as has been traditionally assumed.
Rather, simultaneous ‘‘pull’’ from multiple response alternatives
seems to inﬂuence the execution of movement itself. This ﬁnding
suggests that a dynamic approach to mental processing—an
approach that has already provided descriptions of perception,
attention, and categorization (e.g., Abrams & Balota, 1991; Gold
& Shadlen, 2000; Gratton, Coles, Sirevaag, Eriksen, & Donchin,
1988; Hovland & Sears, 1938; McClelland & Rogers, 2003;
Spivey, 2007; Tipper, Howard, & Houghton, 1999)—may shed
new light on high-level cognition (Roe, Busemeyer, & Townsend, 2001; Townsend & Busemeyer, 1989).
METHOD

The data for this study come from 141 college-age participants
(97 females, 44 males) who responded to 11 yes/no questions
presented in random order over headphones. The questions were
derived from propositions in the Internet-based Mindpixel
project and had varying truth values (deﬁned as the proportion of
participants who responded that they were true). Examples of
the questions include ‘‘Should you brush your teeth everyday?’’

(1.0 true), ‘‘Is murder sometimes justiﬁable?’’ (.6 true), ‘‘Is the
sky ever green?’’ (.3 true), and ‘‘Is a thousand more than a billion?’’ (.0 true).1
We tracked the x and y pixel coordinates of the movements of
the computer mouse that participants used to respond to each
question. Like other reaching actions, reaching movements
made with a computer mouse provide a continuous two-dimensional index of which regions of a scene are guiding action plans
(Spivey, Grosjean, & Knoblich, 2005). To initiate each question,
participants clicked on a small start box at the bottom of a
computer screen. Boxes labeled ‘‘YES’’ and ‘‘NO’’ then appeared in the top left and top right regions of the screen, and a
recorded voice read a question (exactly 2 s in duration). Participants moved the mouse to click on their chosen response box
as quickly and accurately as possible. To ensure that any effects
were not due to the direction of movement, we reversed the
positions of the ‘‘YES’’ and ‘‘NO’’ boxes for 54 participants.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To neutralize small random variations in exact starting position,
we translated each trajectory to begin at x,y coordinates of (0,0).
Each individual trial’s trajectory was interpolated into 101 time
bins. The data from the 54 participants with reversed response
positions did not differ from the data from the rest of the sample,
and therefore were mirror-reversed to permit overlay. The mean
question trajectories fell in a relatively orderly array from left to
right (from ‘‘YES’’ to ‘‘NO’’), their positions corresponding to
Mindpixel truth values (see Fig. 1a). There was a robust relation
between ﬁnal x coordinate and truth value, r 5 .91, F(1, 9) 5
42.8, p 5 .0001, prep 5 .998.
For each trajectory, the degree of curvature was calculated as
maximum deviation (in pixels) relative to a straight line from the
starting position to the ﬁnal position (response click). A histogram of trajectory curvatures (see Fig. 1b) shows that questions
with lower truth values had greater absolute curvature and
broader distribution (lower kurtosis). This indicates that par1

black (0.0 true). The histogram (b) shows curvature distributions separately for questions with high truth value (1.0–0.8; white), low
truth value (0.2–0.0; black), and middle truth value (gray). In (c), average velocity (at about 1 s into the trajectories) is plotted as a
function of time for the same three truth-value groups. The graph in (d) plots the mean sample entropy of trajectories for each question
as a function of distance from equibiased probability (.5); the same shading scheme as in (a) indicates the questions’ truth values.

ticipants experienced greater attraction to the ‘‘YES’’ alternative
while responding ‘‘NO’’ than vice versa. The trajectories for lowtruth-value questions showed signiﬁcantly more curvature than
the trajectories for high-truth-value questions, paired t(140) 5

exhibited a broader distribution around the curvature mean,
showing signiﬁcantly lower kurtosis than high-truth-value
trajectories (95% conﬁdence interval for K 5 0.08  0.23 for
low-truth-value trajectories and 1.09  0.24 for high-truthvalue trajectories).

Trajectory velocity was computed using the distance (in pixels) covered per second over a moving window of six x,y pixel
coordinates. Figure 1c shows the peak velocity for questions
with low, medium, and high truth values, respectively. Peak
velocity was highest for the high-truth-value group and lowest
for the low-truth-value group, F(2, 278) 5 4.2, p < .05. Thus,
‘‘NO’’ responses showed both greater attraction toward the alternative and reduced velocity compared with ‘‘YES’’ responses.
Although low-truth-value questions resulted in trajectories
with the greatest curvature and the lowest peak velocity, a par-

allel-competition account predicts that middle-truth-value
questions, for which the response probabilities are equibiased,
should induce the most competition. The motoric component of
this competition was reﬂected in trajectories’ sample entropy.
Sample entropy is a measure representing the ‘‘disorder’’ of a
time series. For each trajectory’s sequence of x-axis changes
(Dx), we computed this measure by ﬁrst determining the number
of windows of size 3 (M3) that stayed within a given tolerance
(the standard deviation of Dx). We then counted the number of
sequences that were retained when the window size was extended to 4 (M4). Sample entropy was then given by ln (M4/M3)
(Dale, Kehoe, & Spivey, 2007; Richman & Moorman, 2000).
Sample entropy was higher for middle-truth-value questions
than for low- and high-truth-value questions (see Fig. 1d),
quadratic r 5 .70, F(1, 9) 5 8.7, p < .05, prep 5 .939.
These results show that both the spatial extent (see Figs. 1a
and 1b) and the temporal dynamics (see Figs. 1c and 1d) of motor movements can provide insight into high-level cognition
(Rosenbaum, 2005). Our results are consistent with previous
claims regarding proposition veriﬁcation (Barres & JohnsonLaird, 2003; Clark & Chase, 1972; Gilbert, 1991). Speciﬁcally,
we found that evaluating a proposition as false exhibits more
difﬁculty compared with evaluating a proposition as true. Not
only were ‘‘NO’’ responses slower than ‘‘YES’’ responses, but
the ‘‘YES’’ alternative conspicuously competed with the ‘‘NO’’
alternative.
Thus, reasoning about the truth value of a proposition exhibits
a signiﬁcant a priori bias toward ‘‘truth,’’ and this bias must be
overcome before a ‘‘false’’ response can come to fruition. These
continuous arm-movement data are consistent with a dynamic
decision process that continuously ﬂows into the parallel competition and continuous blending of evolving motor commands
(Cisek & Kalaska, 2005). Therefore, theoretical frameworks
based on dynamic, embodied, and distributed processing may
apply not only to perception, attention, and categorization (Dale
et al., 2007; Desimone & Duncan, 1995; Song & Nakayama,
2006; Spivey et al., 2005), but also to high-level cognition. Put
simply, when actions accompany thinking, they are part and
parcel of it.
