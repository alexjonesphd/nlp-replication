Three experiments with short-term recognition tasks are reported. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants
decided whether a probe matched a list item specified by its spatial location. Items presented at study in
a different location (intrusion probes) had to be rejected. Serial position curves of positive, new, and
intrusion probes over the probed location’s position were mostly parallel. Serial position curves of
intrusion probes over their position of origin were again parallel to those of positive probes. Experiment
3 showed largely parallel serial position effects for positive probes and for intrusion probes plotted over
positions in a relevant and an irrelevant list, respectively. The results support a dual-process theory in
which recognition is based on familiarity and recollection, and recollection uses 2 retrieval routes, from
context to item and from item to context.

Sternberg task, these were items from the relevant list. New probes
were items that had not been presented in the current trial at all.
Intrusion probes were list items that had been presented in the
current trial but in the wrong context—in a different frame in local
recognition, or as part of the irrelevant list in the modified Sternberg task. Although they matched an item of the set currently held
in working memory, they had to be rejected because of a mismatch
in the relation between item and context.
Item recognition is the ability to distinguish between positive
probes and new probes; relational recognition is the ability to
distinguish between positive probes and intrusion probes. In the
local recognition paradigm and the modified Sternberg task (Oberauer, 2003, 2005), as in many other recognition paradigms (Gronlund, Edwards, & Ohrt, 1997; Gronlund & Ratcliff, 1989; McElree, Dolan, & Jacoby, 1999), relational recognition has proven to
be harder than item recognition. This is reflected in intrusion costs:
more false alarms are made to intrusion probes than to new probes,
and correct rejections of intrusion probes are slower than those of
new probes. The two theories investigated here address this fact in
different ways.
A second advantage of local recognition and of the modified
Sternberg task is that accuracy and reaction times (RTs) can be
analyzed by serial position in the list not only for positive probes
but also for intrusion probes and, in the case of local recognition,
even for new probes. In global recognition paradigms such as the
traditional Sternberg task, negative (i.e., to be rejected) probes
have no serial position because they bear no relation to any item on
the list. In the local recognition task, however, new probes and
intrusion probes can be analyzed by the serial position of the frame
in which they are presented. For instance, let a list be A(1), B(2),
C(3), with the letter representing the item and the digit in parentheses representing its frame. The probe D(2) would then be a new
probe in serial position 2. In the modified Sternberg task, intrusion
probes have a serial position in the irrelevant list. In this article I
show that the two theories investigated here differ in their predictions for serial position effects on negative probes.

The purpose of the research reported on in this article was to test
two families of theories of recognition, single-process (SP) theories and dual-process (DP) theories, and to help specify in more
detail the process or processes that lead to recognition decisions. In
this research, I focused on short-term recognition as tested with
immediate memory tasks such as the Sternberg paradigm (Sternberg, 1969). In this paradigm, participants are presented with a
short list of items that are followed by a recognition probe after a
delay of a few seconds at best.
Here I use two variants of that paradigm called local recognition
(Oberauer, 2003) and the modified Sternberg task (Oberauer,
2001). In local recognition, each list item was presented in a
different frame on the screen. Recognition probes were then presented in individual frames, and participants decided whether each
probe matched the item presented before in the same frame. The
recognition decision therefore was local to the frame in which the
probe appeared—if the probe matched a list item in a different
frame, it had to be rejected. In the modified Sternberg task,
participants encoded two lists distinguished by their print color,
and one of them was then declared as irrelevant. Recognition
probes had to be compared with the relevant list, excluding the
irrelevant list (see Figure 1).
These two experimental paradigms have two advantages. One is
that they allow the researcher to separate item recognition from
recognition of an item’s relation to its context. To this end I
distinguished three kinds of probes. Positive probes were list items
that should be accepted. In local recognition, these were the list
items that reoccurred in their old frames, and in the modified

Figure 1. Sample trials of the local recognition paradigm (left) and the modified Sternberg paradigm (right).
Each sequence of events represents the display of six memory items, followed by three probes—a positive, an
intrusion, and a new probe, in that order. The two sets in the modified Sternberg task were distinguished by color,
represented here by two different fonts. In the experiments, each local-recognition trial was followed by six
probes, but each modified-Sternberg trial was followed by only one probe; the three probes are shown here for
illustration only.

Two Theories of Short-Term Recognition
In SP theory, item information and relational information are
treated in the same way and integrated into a single value of
global match between the probe and all memory items, which
determines the recognition decision. In DP theory, two processes, familiarity and recollection, contribute to the recognition decision.

item’s identity can be regarded as one such feature, and its
context (i.e., the frame in which it was presented) as another
feature. The same holds for the modified Sternberg task, in
which the color of each item can be regarded as a context
feature.
Recognition decisions are based on a global match value,
which is computed as the summed similarity between the probe
and all list episodes, weighted by a term for the memory
strength of each episode that depends on its serial position:

The SP theory I consider here was modeled after the theory
of Brockdorff and Lamberts (2000). Their SP theory explains
intrusion costs in experiments using negative probes closely
similar to list items (e.g., the singular of a plural noun), and
therefore it provides a potential explanation for intrusion costs
in the two paradigms used here as well. The SP theory assumes
that each item is represented as a conjunction of features, which
I call an episode. Applied to the local recognition paradigm, the

with Ditem representing the distance between the probe and an
episode i on the dimension of item identity, and Dctx representing
their distance on the context dimension. For simplicity, I coded D
as 0 for a match and as 1 for a mismatch between the probe and an
episode on the relevant dimension.1 The free parameter u represents the weight of item matches relative to context matches, and
the free parameter c represents the steepness by which similarity
falls off with distance.
To compute predictions for accuracy and RTs, I used a simplified version of the diffusion model (Ratcliff, 1978; Wagenmakers,
van der Maas, & Grasman, 2007). Details of my application of the
diffusion model are given in the Appendix.

Dual-Process Theory
DP theories assume that recognition decisions are based on two
sources of information: familiarity and recollection (Atkinson,
Herrmann, & Wescourt, 1974; Diana, Reder, Arndt, & Park, 2006;
Mandler, 1980; Yonelinas, 2002). The terms familiarity and recollection are often used to describe subjective experiences associated with a recognition decision—familiarity referring to a feeling
of knowing the probe stimulus, and recollection referring to a
memory of the episode when one has previously encountered that
stimulus. Here I instead use these terms to refer to hypothetical
mechanisms involved in generating recognition decisions, without
making assumptions about accompanying subjective states or
metamemorial judgments. Familiarity is a unidimensional quantity
that is automatically assessed for each stimulus and that reflects
the degree to which the same or a similar stimulus has been
encountered recently. Recollection is the retrieval of an episode in
which the present stimulus, or a similar one, has been encountered
before. Whereas familiarity reflects memory only for the stimulus
itself, recollection reflects memory for the stimulus in a specific
context that defines the retrieved episode.
Applied to the local recognition task and the modified Sternberg
task, familiarity reflects the degree to which the probe matches one
or several items represented in working memory: All probes
matching a list item of the current trial can be assumed to be highly
familiar, regardless of their context. For example, in the local
recognition task, probes matching an item in the probed frame and
probes matching an item in another frame are equally familiar.
Recollection provides information about the context of a recently
encountered probe—for example, in which frame it was seen.
Familiarity is sufficient for item recognition (i.e., for distinguishing between positive probes and new probes), but recollection is
necessary for relational recognition (i.e., for distinguishing between positive probes and intrusion probes). Intrusion probes are
more difficult to reject than new probes, according to DP theories,
because in response to an intrusion probe, familiarity and recollection drive the decision tendency in opposite directions, whereas
with new and with positive probes they cooperate toward the same
response.
Familiarity could be assumed to vary with serial position—for
example, the strength of an item’s representation might decay over

441

time (Anderson & Lebiere, 1998), or the items at the beginning of
a list might be encoded more strongly (Farrell & Lewandowsky,
2002), but for simplicity I assume that familiarity has a constant
value of 1 for all probes matching any list item (i.e., for all positive
and intrusion probes), and 0 for all new probes. All serial-position
effects therefore are assumed to arise from the recollection process.
Recollection can use two directions of retrieval. Recollection1
functions by using the relevant context as a retrieval cue to recall
the item or items associated to it. The recalled item or items are
then compared with the probe. In the local recognition task, the
relevant context is the probed frame, and recollection retrieves the
item that has been presented in that frame. In the modified Sternberg task, the relevant context is a representation of the relevant
list, and recollection is an attempt to recall all relevant list items.
This process is modeled after theories of serial recall in which a
representation of the list position to be recalled acts as a cue for the
associated item (Burgess & Hitch, 1999; Henson, 1998).
Recollection2 is the reverse process. The probe itself is used as
a cue to retrieve the context to which it has been associated in the
current trial, if it has been presented in that trial at all. If the
retrieved context is not the relevant context, or if no context can be
retrieved at all, the probe is rejected. For example, in the local
recognition task, recollection would consist of retrieving the frame
in which the probed item has been presented, and if that frame is
not the frame that is presently probed, the item is rejected. Recollection2 is inspired by the recognition model of Sikström (2004),
which is a SP model in which recognition decisions rely in part on
the degree to which a list context can be retrieved from the probe
as cue.
To formalize Recollection1, I assume that the probe is compared
with each element of the set I of all items retrieved from the
relevant context. The process returns a value of M ⫽ 1 whenever
the probe matches one item in that set, and of M ⫽ ⫺1 otherwise.
This value is weighted by the strength SI of the item or items that
determine the outcome—in the case of a match, SI equals the
strength of the matching item, and in case of no match, SI equals
the average strength of all items in I:
rec1 ⫽ S I M共 probe,I兲.

(3)

Recollection2 is formalized in a similar way. The context retrieved
using the probe as a cue is compared to the set C of all relevant
contexts (i.e., the probed frame in local recognition, and the set of
all serial positions of the relevant list in the modified Sternberg
task). In case of a match, M ⫽ 1, and in case of no match, M ⫽ ⫺1.
If a context of origin can be retrieved for the probe, the strength
term equals the strength of that context. If no context of origin can
be retrieved, Recollection2 returns M ⫽ ⫺1 with strength SC ⫽ 1:

The outcomes of the two recollection processes are combined into
a weighted sum to obtain an overall recollection value:

In a more realistic model, Ditem would be graded by the similarity
between the probe and each item, and Dctx would be graded by the temporal
or ordinal distance between the probed serial position and the item’s
position, but this level of detail is not necessary for deriving the shape of
the serial position function predicted by the SP model.

Parameter d controls the relative weight of the two recollection
directions. A special version DP1 can be derived by setting d ⫽ 1,
thereby using only the context-to-item route; a special version DP2
is derived by setting d ⫽ 0, thereby using only the item-to-context
route.
Finally, the overall recognition signal is computed as a weighted
sum of familiarity and recollection (see Göthe & Oberauer, in
press, for a detailed discussion of ways to integrate familiarity and
recollection information):

in the middle of the list, and items become weaker when they are
probed later in the test sequence.

Parameter f controls the relative weight of familiarity and recollection. Predictions for RTs and accuracies are derived by feeding
m into the diffusion model, as explained in the Appendix.

Predictions for Serial Position Curves in Local
Recognition
Experiments 1 and 2 used the local recognition paradigm, and in
this section I address the derivations of predictions from the
theories under investigation for this paradigm. Derivations for the
predictions for the modified Sternberg task are addressed in the
introduction to Experiment 3.
In the experiments with the local recognition task, each list was
followed by six probes. There were two presentation conditions. In
the serial condition, items were presented from left to right, and
probes appeared in the same left–right order. In the random condition, items were presented in random order across the frames,
and probes were displayed in a new random order. Thus, in the
random condition, serial position of presentation is deconfounded
from serial position of test. I focus here on serial position of
presentation—that is, the order in which items are presented.
With one exception (position of origin of intrusion probes; see
below), serial position is defined as the position of the probed
frame in the presentation order. For example, in the random
condition a list might be A(3), B(1), C(4), D(2). Frame 3 would
then be assigned serial position 1; frame 1 would receive serial
position 2; frame 4, position 3; and frame 2, position 4. Performance on a probe presented in frame 3 would contribute to
accuracy and latency measures for serial position 1, performance
on a probe in frame 1 would count toward measures for position 2,
and so on.
I assume that serial position affects the strength of a memory
representation, denoted S in the preceding equations. The purpose
of the present article is not to explain serial position effects (see
Oberauer, 2003, for a discussion of explanations of serial position
effects), so the models capture them in a purely descriptive way. I
assume that after encoding a list, each item’s strength is determined by a primacy gradient falling off exponentially from the
start and a recency gradient falling off exponentially from the end.
An additional factor to be taken into consideration is output
interference. In the random condition of the present experiments,
test position is uncorrelated with list position, so output interference is averaged out in the serial position curves. However, in the
serial presentation condition, test position is perfectly correlated
with list position, and this implies that items toward the end of the

Predictions From the Single-Process Model
The mathematical expressions for the predictions from the two
models are provided in the Appendix; here I give a verbal explanation. Positive probes match exactly one episode with regard to
both content and position, returning a similarity value of 1. Similarity to all other episodes is fairly low, so global match will be
largely determined by the matching item. That item’s strength is
determined by its serial position, with higher strength values in the
primacy and recency portions than in the middle. Therefore, accuracies should show a U-shaped serial position curve, and RTs an
inverse U-shaped curve.
New probes match one episode on the position dimension—
namely, the episode involving the probed position, but they do not
match that episode on the item dimension, so similarity to that
episode will be substantially below 1. Similarity to all other
episodes is again fairly small. The global match value will thus be
low, but it will be somewhat higher in the primacy and recency
portions than in the middle of the list, because the partially
matching episode has more strength in the primacy and recency
positions.
Intrusion probes match the episode in the probed position p
on the position dimension and the episode in the probe’s position of origin o on the item identity dimension. Thus, the overall
match of an intrusion probe includes the similarity on the item
dimension multiplied by the strength term for o, and the similarity on the position dimension multiplied by the strength term
for p. As a consequence, the global match value will be determined by the strength of the probed position as well as by the
strength of the position of origin of the probe. The relative
contribution of these two strength components depends on the
relative weight of the two dimensions of similarity, governed by
parameter u in Equation 2.
To summarize, the global match values of all three probe types
will be larger in the primacy and recency positions than in the
middle positions. All probe types are therefore more likely to be
accepted when a primacy or a recency position is probed. This
leads to primacy and recency advantages for positive probes.
Accepting new and intrusion probes, however, is incorrect, and
therefore serial position curves of accuracy for these probes will
show the inverse shape of those for positive probes, with lower
accuracy in primacy and recency positions. A similar expectation
can be formulated for RTs of correct responses. Positive probes in
the strong primacy and recency positions will be accepted more
easily and therefore faster; negative probes in the strong primacy
and recency positions will be more difficult to reject and therefore
will elicit longer RTs for correct rejections.

Consider, for example, a list A(1), B(2), C(3). A positive probe
A(1) matches the episode in the strong primacy position on both
dimensions and therefore generates a high match value, leading
with high likelihood to a fast hit. A new probe presented in the
same frame, D(1), would match the strong primacy position on the
context dimension, again leading to a (for new probes) relatively
high match value, which results in a high chance of a false alarm
or a slow rejection. Finally, an intrusion probe in the same frame,
B(1), would receive a relatively high contribution to its match
value from the context dimension, but a comparatively low contribution from the item dimension, because its position of origin is
the weak middle position. This last example shows that the match
values of intrusion probes, and therefore the difficulty of rejecting
them, is a function of their list position p (i.e., the position of the
probed frame) and their position of origin o. In both cases, stronger
serial positions—that is, primacy and recency positions—should
lead to more false alarms and slower rejections.

These intuitive predictions are borne out when the model is run.
The predictions of the SP model are shown in the left column of
Figure 2 (for accuracies) and of Figure 3 (for latencies). These
predictions were generated with parameters given in Table 1. The
parameters for this and the other model predictions in this article
were chosen to provide approximate fits to the serial position
curves of accuracies and RTs of positive probes, and to the overall
level of negative probes. Thus, the parameter settings were informed only by aspects of the data that are not the main focus of
investigation in the present article; the shapes of the serial position
curves for new and intrusion probes can be regarded as real
predictions.
The first two panels in each column of Figures 2 and 3 show
predictions for serial position curves, with serial position defined
as list position (i.e., the position of the probed frame in the
presentation order of the list). Predictions for the serial condition
are in the top panel. The contribution of output interference is

are averaged out; consequently, the curves are symmetrical. In
both cases, the serial position curves for new and intrusion probes
bow in the direction opposite to that for the positive probe. The
curvature is much less pronounced for the two kinds of negative
probes than for the positive probes because the match values of
negative probes have a smaller relative contribution from the
strength of the probed position, as their similarity to that episode
is lower.
The bottom panel shows predictions for intrusion probes plotted
by their position of origin (averaging over probe position). There
is again a slight curvature opposite to that for positive probes, this
time arising from the strength of the position of origin, which
contributes to the match values of intrusion probes.

Predictions From the Dual-Process Model
In the DP model, serial position effects come about entirely
through recollection. Recollection1 consists of retrieving the item
or items associated with the relevant context. In the case of a
positive probe, this process will return a match, the strength of
which is determined by the strength of the probed position. In the
case of a negative or an intrusion probe, Recollection1 will return
a mismatch, the strength of which again reflects the strength of the
probed position. Therefore, to the degree that Recollection1 contributes to overall recollection, probes in strong list positions can
be expected to elicit high hit rates and high rates of correct
rejections, both with relatively short latencies.
Recollection2 consists of trying to retrieve a list context from the
probe as cue. In local recognition that is the frame in which the
probe has been presented, if it has been a list item at all. In the case
of a positive probe this is the frame in the probed position, and the
strength of the match value is determined again by the probed
position. In the case of a negative probe, no frame is retrieved. The
strength of the resulting mismatch value cannot depend on serial
position and thus is assumed to be 1; therefore, Recollection2 does
not generate serial-position effects for new probes. For intrusion
probes, however, the position of origin can be retrieved as a
context, and this information would help to reject that probe. The
mismatch value returned by Recollection2 for intrusion probes
therefore is weighted by the strength of the position of origin of the
probe. As a consequence, Recollection2 should produce serialposition effects for intrusion probes when plotted over their position of origin. Again, strong positions lead to larger mismatch
values, which translate into faster and more accurate rejection of
intrusion probes. Therefore, the predicted serial position curves for
intrusion probes over position of origin bend in the same direction
as the serial position curves for positive probes.
To summarize, the DP model predicts that serial position curves
of accuracies and latencies will bow in the same direction for all
three probe types. The predictions based on parameters given in
Table 1 can be seen in the right column of Figures 2 and 3.
Predicted serial position curves for new probes are shallower than
those for positive and intrusion probes because recollection plays
a smaller role in the decisions on new probes, which can be
rejected on their lack of familiarity, than on the other two probe
types, which must recruit recollection to distinguish between them.
An additional prediction is that success in rejecting intrusion
probes should increase with the strength of those probes’ positions
of origin. Again, strong positions of origin would lead to better
performance. This prediction is illustrated in the bottom right
panels of Figures 2 and 3.
The predictions for serial position effects on new and intrusion
probes, as plotted in Figures 2 and 3, hold only if both directions
of recollection contribute to the overall recognition signal. This is
the case for the value of parameter d ⫽ 0.5 used to generate the
plotted predictions. The model’s behavior changes when d assumes more extreme values. With d ⫽ 1.0, the model uses only
Recollection1, and as a consequence, the serial position curve of
intrusion probes over their position of origin becomes flat. Conversely, for d ⫽ 0.0, the model uses only Recollection2, and the
serial position curve for new probes and intrusion probes over the
probed list position becomes flat (the predictions for positive
probes do not change because for them, probed position and

445

position of origin is identical, rendering d ineffective). Therefore,
we can use the serial position curves of new and intrusion probes
not only to adjudicate between DP and SP but also to diagnose the
role of the two retrieval directions within a viable DP model.

Experiments 1 and 2
The predictions are tested with data from two experiments.2 The
only difference between these experiments is that Experiment 1
had about equal numbers of new and intrusion probes among its
negative probes, whereas Experiment 2 had only positive and
intrusion probes.

Method
Participants
In each experiment 30 psychology undergraduates at the University of Potsdam, Germany, participated in partial fulfillment of
obligations of a lab course or in exchange for 5 euros (€).

Materials and Procedure
Each trial started with the presentation of a row of six square
frames in the middle of a computer screen in white on a black
background. After 500 ms, six consonants were presented in white,
one in each frame, with a presentation time of 400 ms followed by
an interstimulus interval of 100 ms for each letter. The two
conditions of presentation order, serial and random, were realized
in separate blocks in counterbalanced order. In the serial condition,
the consonants were presented from left to right; in the random
condition, their presentation order was determined at random for
each trial and participant. Lists were built by randomly selecting
from the 20 consonants (excluding Y) without repetitions. The first
probe appeared 600 ms after offset of the last list item in one of the
frames (for an illustration, see Figure 1). Participants judged
whether the probe matched the letter presented in that frame by
pressing the left or the right arrow key; the assignment of the arrow
keys to “yes” or “no” was chosen by each participant at the
beginning of the experiment. The next probe followed 200 ms after
the response, for a total of six probes. In the serial presentation
condition, the probes were presented in left-to-right order, thereby
matching the order of list presentation across the frames. In the
random condition presentation of probes followed a new random
order independent of list presentation order. Serial position is
defined as position in the presentation order.
In Experiment 1, across all trials 50% of probes were positive
and the remaining ones were negative, with 24% new and 26%
intrusion probes. In Experiment 2, each probe corresponded to a
different letter of the list; half of them were positive and half were
intrusion probes. In both experiments, positive probes were evenly
distributed over serial positions across all trials of the experiment
in a randomized order, whereas serial positions of negative probes
were determined at random without constraints.
Each participant completed 12 practice trials followed by 156
test trials (each with six probes) in a 1-hr session. At the end of

was correct and the latency did not exceed 5 s. In Experiment 1,

or a few design cells; these missing values, 14 in total, were
replaced by the group means for the affected design cell.
Figure 4 shows accuracies of the three probe types in Experiment 1, and Figure 5 shows the corresponding response latencies.
Figure 6 shows accuracies of positive probes and of intrusion
probes in Experiment 2, and Figure 7 displays the corresponding
latencies. All four figures show that serial position curves of
intrusion probes tracked those of positive probes remarkably well.
The serial position curves of new probes in Experiment 1 tended to
be shallower, but where they were bent, they were bent in the same
direction as positive probes. This pattern is incompatible with SP,
but it matches the predictions of DP very well.
This impression was confirmed by analyses of variance
(ANOVAs) in which serial position was coded by linear and
quadratic contrasts to capture trends in the curves. In one case—
latencies in the serial presentation condition—the cubic rather than
the quadratic trend was considered because a cubic trend was
strongly implied by the data. Out of 24 analyses of interactions
between serial position and probe type3 only 5 became significant
at the conventional .05 alpha level. Three of those concerned the
comparison of positive and new probes in Experiment 1: In the
serial condition, positive versus new probes interacted with the
quadratic trend of serial position effects on accuracies, F(1, 29) ⫽
9.2, p ⫽ .005, ␩2p ⫽ .24. This interaction reflects the fact that new
probes do not show the one-item recency effect observed for
positive probes. In the random condition, positive versus new
probes interacted with the quadratic trend on both accuracies and
RTs, F(1, 29) ⫽ 9.2, p ⫽ .005, ␩2p ⫽ .24 for accuracies, and F(1,
29) ⫽ 5.8, p ⫽ .023, ␩2p ⫽ .17 for RTs. These two interactions
reflect the fact that serial position curves for new probes were
essentially flat in the random condition, whereas positive probes
displayed primacy and recency effects.
One of the two remaining interactions signals the lack of the
one-item recency effect in accuracies of intrusion probes in the
serial-presentation condition of Experiment 2, F(1, 29) ⫽ 4.6, p ⫽
.041, ␩2p ⫽ .14. The other reflects the different shape of the
accuracy position curves of positive and intrusion probes in Experiment 1, random condition, F(1, 29) ⫽ 4.3, p ⫽ .047, ␩2p ⫽ .13.
Primacy and recency effects extended further into the middle of
the list for intrusion probes than for positive probes. These two
effects were small and appear to be unsystematic, so I do not
discuss them further.
In those cases where the interactions were not significant, it is
important to show that this was not due to small serial position
effects or to a lack of power. To this end I tested for serial position
effects of individual probe types; the results are summarized in
Table 2 and Table 3. Out of 10 significant serial position effects for
positive probes, 6 were replicated in the data from intrusion
probes. Those not replicated were, in both experiments, the quadratic trends on accuracy in the serial condition, and the quadratic
trends on latencies in the random condition. The same two effects
were also not reproduced in the data from new probes (Experiment

presented in list position 1. Only data from Experiment 2 are
analyzed because there were twice as many intrusion probes in that
experiment as in Experiment 1.
The position of origin had significant effects on the accuracy of
rejecting intrusion probes, and these effects match those found for
positive probes. In the serial presentation condition, symmetric

Discussion
An SP model and a DP model make qualitatively different
predictions for serial position curves in the local recognition paradigm. The SP model predicts that serial position curves for
negative probes (i.e., new and intrusion probes) bow in the direction opposite from those for positive probes. The DP model predicts that they bow in the same direction, with relatively shallow
curvature for new probes and more pronounced curvature for
positive and intrusion probes. The predictions of the DP were
further modulated by the assumed direction of retrieval involved in
recollection. Context-to-item retrieval predicts bowed serial position curves of negative probes plotted over the list position of the
probed frame, whereas item-to-context retrieval predicts bowed
serial position curves for intrusion probes when plotted over their
position of origin.

intrusion probes in the random condition are split between an
effect of the probed position and an effect of the position of origin.
As a consequence, serial position effects on intrusion probes are
predicted to be less pronounced than those for positive probes in
the random condition, a prediction also visible in Figures 2 and 3.
This could explain why, in the random condition, not all position
effects observed for positive probes were replicated in the intrusion probes.
There was one conspicuous discrepancy between the predictions
of DP and the data, namely the cubic rather than quadratic trend in
the serial position curves of latencies for the serial presentation
condition. The cubic trend can be interpreted as a combination of
an inverse U-shaped curve, which is predicted by the DP model,
with a substantial time added to the first list item. The same pattern
of latencies has been observed for forward serial recall—the time
for recalling the first item is much longer than the times for
recalling successive items (Anderson & Matessa, 1997; Maybery,
Parmentier, & Jones, 2002). This long latency on the first item has
nothing to do with its strength, because the first list item is
typically recalled best, and it showed best recognition accuracy in
the present experiments. A plausible interpretation is that, when a
forward test order is anticipated, participants take time for preparing retrieval of the whole list in order before responding to the first
item. The DP model could easily be amended by a further free
parameter to capture this additional preparation time.

Experiment 3 tests the SP model and the DP model with the
modified Sternberg task (Oberauer, 2001). On each trial, participants encoded a series of six words, subdivided into two lists by
their color— one list was displayed in red and the other in blue.
One list contained two words and the other list contained four
words. Following the last word, a color cue indicated which of the
two lists was relevant for the recognition decision. Participants
then decided for a single probe whether it was in the relevant list.
Serial position can be determined for positive probes as well as for
the serial position of origin for intrusion probes (i.e., probes
coming from the irrelevant list).

probes in Experiment 2, plotted over the position of the probe item in the
input sequence. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals for withinsubject comparisons (Bakeman & McArthur, 1996).

The results contradict the predictions of SP but are in good
agreement with those of DP. Support for DP comes from the
paucity of interactions between probe type and serial position and
the finding of a number of significant serial-position effects on
negative probes that had the same shape as those of positive probes
in the same conditions. Where positive and negative position
curves were not parallel, the interactions mostly came from the fact
that new probes displayed shallower position curves, and this is
predicted by the DP model (see Figures 2 and 3). The predictions
of both retrieval directions within DP were supported, suggesting
that both retrieval routes contribute with substantial weight to
recollection. This result implies that the serial position effects on

Model Predictions for the Modified Sternberg Task
The Single-Process Model
The SP model computes global match from the similarities of
the probe to all six memory episodes. Similarity is computed from
the distance on the item dimension and the context dimension (i.e.,
color). Similarity is weighted by the strength of each episode,
which depends on its serial position. Serial position effects are
assumed to apply to the whole series of six items regardless of its
subdivision into two lists; thus, the strongest items are the first
item of the first list and the last item of the second list. The
equations resulting from the application of the SP model to the
modified Sternberg task are given in the Appendix. The predictions are illustrated on the left side of Figure 9 (for accuracies) and
Figure 10 (for latencies). These predictions, and those for the DP
model described below, were generated with the same parameters
as those for the local recognition tasks (see Table 1), with one
exception: Because the global match values were higher in the case

list. New probes do not have serial positions in this paradigm, but
they can be differentiated by the list length of the relevant list; the
predictions for new probes for long lists, N(L), and for short lists,
N(S), are plotted on the right side of each panel.
The SP model predicts once again that serial position curves for
intrusion probes are inversely bowed relative to those of positive
probes. The SP model also predicts that intrusion probes are more
difficult to reject than new probes because intrusion probes gain in
match value from their similarity to an irrelevant-list item. In
addition, the model predicts that new probes and intrusion probes
are harder to reject when the relevant list is long, because these
probes match more memory episodes on the context dimension,
thereby generating larger match values (note that intrusion probes
from long lists correspond to shorter relevant lists). For positive
probes, the SP model predicts the opposite—positive probes from
short lists are predicted to be more difficult because they match
fewer memory items on the context dimension.

The Dual-Process Model
Whereas in local recognition Recollection1 consists of retrieving one item associated with a single position cue, in the
modified Sternberg task Recollection1 consists of retrieving all
items from the relevant list and comparing them to the probe. If
a match is found, the outcome M is set to 1, and if no match is
found, M ⫽ ⫺1. In case of a match, M is multiplied with the
strength of the matching item, and in case of no match, M is
multiplied with the average strength of all items on the relevant
list. The attempt to retrieve all items in the relevant list could be
a serial or a parallel process, but in either case we should expect
Recollection1 to become more difficult as the length of the
relevant list increases. Therefore, strength is reduced with increasing list length of the relevant list; this reduction is governed by a free parameter C (see Equation A15 in the Appendix). For Recollection 2, strength is computed as in local
recognition, because in both tasks item-to-context retrieval involves retrieval of a single context from a single probe as cue.4
The predictions of the DP model are shown on the right side of
Figures 9 and 10. As before, the model predicts largely parallel
serial position curves for positive and intrusion probes. Intrusion
probes are predicted to be more difficult than new probes because
familiarity is added to the recognition signal. In addition, DP
predicts list length effects in favor of short relevant lists for
positive and for new probes. Positive probes are accepted more
easily when the relevant list is short because memory traces have
more strength, making it easier for Recollection1 to find the
matching item in the relevant list. New probes are easier to reject
when the relevant list is short for the same reason: It is easier for
Recollection1 to determine that the probe does not match any of
the relevant-list items. The predictions for intrusion probes are not
straightforward: The list length effect on strength makes intrusion
probes easier to reject through Recollection1 when the relevant list
is short, for the same reasons as with new probes. At the same
time, these intrusion probes originate from the long list, which
renders strength for Recollection2 smaller on average, due to the
trough in the serial position curve.
Once again, certain features of the predictions of DP enable
identification of the effects of context-to-item recollection and of
item-to-context recollection. When d is set to 0, eliminating

451

context-to-item retrieval, the list length effect for new probes
disappears. When d is set to 1, eliminating item-to-context retrieval, serial position effects for intrusion probes disappear.

Method
Participants
Participants were 32 students in the last 2 years of high school,
recruited from schools in Potsdam, Germany. They participated in
two 1-hr sessions and were reimbursed with 12 €. They were
assigned to one of two groups in alternating order.

Materials and Procedure
The materials consisted of 400 one- and two-syllable German
nouns. In each trial, six nouns were selected at random from this
pool, with the constraint that the nouns have not been used as
memory items in any previous trial of the same block. The six
selected words were assigned at random to the six serial positions. The set of six words was subdivided into two lists. For
participants in the long–short group, the first four words formed
the first list, and the remaining two words formed the second
list. For the short–long group, the first two words formed the
first list and the other four words formed the second list.
Each of the two sessions consisted of eight blocks of 32 trials
each. In each trial, the six words were presented centrally one by
one for 700 ms, followed by a 100-ms blank interval. The first list
of two or four words (depending on group) was displayed in red,
and the second list was displayed in blue on a black background.
Half a second following the offset of the last word, a red or blue
frame appeared centrally; its color indicated which list should be
regarded as relevant. The probe appeared in the frame 100 ms later
in the same color as the frame. Participants were instructed to
decide as quickly and accurately as possible whether the probe was
contained in the relevant list. They gave their responses by pressing on the left or the right arrow key. Immediate feedback followed
a key press in the form of a brief high tone for correct responses
and a low tone for incorrect responses. The next trial began 1.5 s
after the feedback tone.
Half the probes were positive—that is, they were contained in
the relevant list; 25% were new probes not contained in any
present list or in any previous memory list of the same block; and
25% of probes were intrusion probes—that is, probes from the
4

This is not to say that list length had no bearing on item-to-context
retrieval—representations in working memory are known to become increasingly weak the more items must be maintained simultaneously. This
list length effect, however, is an effect of the total number of elements in
working memory, which is a constant of six in all experiments reported
here, and therefore does not need to be modeled explicitly. At least part of
it is implicitly modeled by the fact that with longer lists, the primacy and
recency parameters decline further, leaving the middle list positions weaker
than with shorter lists. Data from Monsell (1978) and McElree and Dosher
(1989), who varied list length and serial position in the Sternberg task,
show that serial position effects account for a large part, but not all, of the
list length effects in that task.

Reaction times for incorrect responses (13.1%) and those exceeding 3 s (0.2%) were discarded. Mean accuracies on positive
and intrusion probes are presented by serial position for the two
groups in Figure 11, and Figure 12 shows the corresponding RT
data. Data points connected by lines reflect serial positions within
the same list. The figures also show the data for new probes by the
length of the relevant list.
The first set of analyses focuses on serial position curves. The
SP model predicts that these curves bow in opposite directions for
positive and intrusion probes, whereas the DP model predicts that
their shapes are parallel. I tested these hypotheses separately for
the two groups because serial position effects differed between
groups, but there was no hypothesis concerning the interaction of
serial position effects with group. I conducted an ANOVA for each
group, each dependent measure, and each list, with probe type
(positive vs. intrusion) and serial position as independent variables. For long lists, I tested for interactions of linear and of
quadratic trends over serial position with probe type.
Of the 12 interactions (2 for long lists and 1 for short lists ⫻ 2
dependent variables and 2 groups), 4 were significant. For accuracies, these involved the quadratic trend of serial position in the
short–long group, F(1, 15) ⫽ 6.4, p ⫽ .02, ␩2p ⫽ .30, and the linear
trend in the long–short group, F(1, 15) ⫽ 10.4, p ⫽ .006, ␩2p ⫽ .41.
As can be seen in Figure 11, both of these interactions are derived
from the fact that intrusion probes were responded to less accurately on the serial positions where the irrelevant list bordered the
relevant list (i.e., the first position in the short–long group, and the
last two positions in the long–short group). For RTs, the significant
interactions involved the linear trend in the short–long group, F(1,
15) ⫽ 8.0, p ⫽ .013, ␩2p ⫽ .35, and the quadratic trend in the
long–short group, F(1, 15) ⫽ 11.7, p ⫽ .004, ␩2p ⫽ .44. The first
of these interactions reflects a more pronounced recency advantage
for positive than for intrusion probes when the long list came last.
The second interaction is driven mainly by the pronounced increase in RTs for intrusion probes at the last position of the long
list, which borders the short list following it, whereas no such
increase was found for positive probes.
For 8 of 12 analyses there was no significant interaction of serial
position with probe type, but that does not imply that the two probe
types show parallel effects of serial position. To test whether they
do, I analyzed serial position effects for positive and for intrusion
probes separately; the results of these analyses are summarized in
Table 4. In 6 of the 12 comparisons, there were significant effects
in the same direction for positive and for intrusion probes.
The second analysis tests the hypothesis, shared by the two
models, that intrusion probes were responded to less quickly and
accurately than new probes. ANOVAs with probe type (new vs.
intrusion), length of the relevant list (2 vs. 4), and group as
independent variables yielded significant main effects of probe
type for both accuracy and RT as dependent variable, F(1, 31) ⫽

A final set of analyses concerned list length effects of the
relevant list. The SP model predicts that list length affects negative
probes and positive probes in opposite ways, whereas the DP
model predicts that positive and new probes are easier when the
relevant list is short and makes no firm predictions for intrusion
probes. An ANOVA with probe type (3) and list length of the

accuracies were lower with longer relevant lists. For RTs, there
was again a main effect of list length, F(1, 31) ⫽ 51.8, p ⬍ .001,
␩2p ⫽ .63, but it interacted with probe type, F(1, 31) ⫽ 6.8, p ⫽
.009, ␩2p ⫽ .18. Longer relevant lists led to slower responses to
positive and new probes, but list length had no effect on intrusion
probes.
The list length effect on new probes is particularly relevant for
diagnosing the context-to-item retrieval route, and therefore I
investigated it separately. As predicted from the assumption of

The results of Experiment 3 are inconsistent with the SP model
on two accounts: Serial position curves for positive and for intrusion probes were mostly parallel, and list length effects of positive
and new probes went in the same direction, with better performance on trials with short relevant lists. Both these patterns were
predicted by the DP model. The third prediction of the DP model,
better performance on new than on intrusion probes, was also
confirmed. Moreover, the experiment yielded support for both
retrieval directions within the DP model. Item-to-context retrieval
was demonstrated by the effect of the serial position of origin on
intrusion probes. Context-to-item retrieval was demonstrated by
the list length effect on new probes.
There were four deviations between serial position curves of
positive and intrusion probes, which are not predicted by DP.
Three of them reflect a specific difficulty with intrusion probes
coming from positions close to the relevant list. These effects can
be understood as arising from a difficulty in discriminating between the two lists. If representations of adjacent serial positions
overlap, as is assumed in contemporary models of serial-order
memory (e.g., Burgess & Hitch, 1999; Henson, 1998), recall of the
list context from a probe as cue will lead to ambiguous results if
the list context lies at the boundary between the two lists. This is
true for both positive and intrusion probes but, whereas for positive
probes information from familiarity converges with information
from recollection, thereby rendering accurate recollection of the
probe’s list context somewhat redundant, discriminating between
relevant and irrelevant list is crucial for decisions on intrusion
probes. This explains why performance on intrusion probes suffers
more than that on positive probes at serial positions close to the list
boundary. The DP model in its current form does not include a
parameter for discriminability between contexts, but including one
would be a straightforward extension.
The fourth point of deviation between serial position effects of
positive and intrusion probes was the larger recency effect in RTs
to positive probes in the short–long group. One tentative explanation for this effect is that, in addition to serial position effects on
recollection, there is also a recency effect on the degree of familiarity, which helps acceptance of recent positive probes but impairs
rejection of recent intrusion probes. The fact that there was nevertheless a recency advantage even for intrusion probes, and the
interaction of probe type and serial position was not found for the
short list in the long–short group, shows that this effect cannot be
very strong. A strong recency effect on familiarity would have
driven the observed recency effects on positive and on intrusion
probes in opposite directions, and this was not the case.

General Discussion
I tested two models of short–term recognition—a single-process
model and a dual-process model. The models were tested with two
experimental paradigms that made it possible to distinguish be-

tween item recognition and relational recognition. Both models
incorporated the distinction between item information and contextual information and therefore could handle the fact that relational
recognition was more difficult than item recognition. The two
models could be distinguished by their predictions for serial position effects on negative, to-be-rejected probes, and (in Experiment
3) by their predictions for list length effects. The DP model
predicted largely parallel serial position curves for all probe types
and parallel list length effects for positive and new probes, whereas
the SP model predicted that both of these effects go in opposite
directions for positive and negative probes. The results of all three
experiments clearly favor the DP model. In addition, the results
provide support for two assumed directions of retrieval in the
recollection component of the DP model. Recollection is based on
context-to-item retrieval and on item-to-context retrieval.

Necessary Features of a Theory of Short-Term
Recognition
Which characteristics of the models are responsible for the
success of the DP model and the failure of the SP model? Two
critical features can be identified. First, the SP model uses a signal
that reflects only positive evidence for a match, whereas a mismatch is simply represented by a relative lack of match evidence.
As a consequence, strong representations elicit stronger evidence
for a match with a positive probe, thereby making hits easier, but
they do not elicit stronger evidence for a mismatch with a negative
probe. Thus, the SP model has no mechanism to generate better
performance on negative probes presented in stronger serial positions. The recollection process in the DP model, in contrast,
provides evidence for a match (positive values of M) as well as for
a mismatch (negative values of M). Therefore, stronger items yield
stronger evidence for a match when compared with a positive
probe and stronger evidence for a mismatch when compared with
a negative probe.
The second critical feature is that the SP model compares each
probe to all episodes in memory, whereas the DP model has one
process, familiarity, that compares the probe to all memory items,
and another process, recollection, that is limited to the relevant
item or items. The importance of this second feature can be

demonstrated by investigating a variant of the SP model that
introduces the first feature, positive evidence for a mismatch. To
do so, we can subtract from the similarity between the probe and
each episode a neutral baseline B that represents the value on the
similarity scale at which the evidence is inconclusive. Similarity
values above B would be regarded as evidence for accepting a
probe, and values below B would be regarded as evidence for a
rejection. Thus, Equation 1 would be modified to

冘
n

m⫽

Si共simprobe,i ⫺ B兲

(8)

i⫽1

With this modification, mismatches of a probe with an episode in
a strong position would yield negative values multiplied with a
large value Si, thereby providing stronger evidence for rejection,
compared with mismatches of a probe with an episode in a weak
position. Nonetheless, this modified SP model still predicts serial
position curves for negative probes that mirror those for positive
probes, rather than being parallel. This is so because the evidence
for a probe’s match or mismatch is summed across all memory
episodes, rather than being confined to the relevant set of episodes.
Consider two new probes in the local recognition task, one in the
strong serial position 1 and one in the weaker serial position 3. For
both of them there will be positive evidence for a mismatch
coming from all six memory episodes on the item dimension, and
from five memory episodes on the context dimension. Both of
them, however, also receive one piece of evidence for a match,
namely a match on the context dimension with the episode on the
probed position. For the probe in the strong position 1 this evidence for a match is stronger than for the probe in the weak
position 3, and therefore the global match of a new probe in
position 1 is larger, making it more difficult to reject that probe.
There is a way of formulating an SP model that comes very
close to realizing both critical features. In this version of SP,
memory episodes are encoded by values between 0 and 1 on each
feature dimension, with a neutral value of 0.5. Values greater than
0.5 represent the presence of a feature, and values less than 0.5
represent its absence. An interpretation of these values is that they
represent the conditional probability of a feature, given the pres-

SHORT-TERM RECOGNITION

ence of an object or an episode. McClelland and Chappell (1998)
built their subjective-likelihood model on this representation assumption; the SP model considered next is a much simplified
version of that model, designed to investigate how far an SP model
can be pushed in explaining the present data.
The strength of a memory episode determines how much a
feature value deviates from the neutral value 0.5:

with fi,d for the feature value of episode i on dimension d, Si the
strength of episode i, and c a free parameter governing how
quickly f deviates from 0.5 with increasing strength. As strength Si
increases, the term in the square bracket increases, and the feature
value fi,d deviates more from the neutral value of 0.5. The match
between a probe and a memory episode is computed as
mprobe,i ⫽ 关1 ⫺ Ditem共 probe,i兲兴 u 䡠 关1 ⫺ Dctx共 probe,i兲兴 1⫺u.

(10)

In this expression, D represents the distance between the probe and
the memory episode i, defined as the absolute difference between
the probe’s feature value (0 or 1) and the episode’s feature value
fi,d on the respective dimension. Parameter u determines the relative contributions of item and context dimension. The global match
is computed by adding up the matches of a probe to all memory
episodes.
This version of the SP model creates positive evidence for a
mismatch, which increases with strength: The more fi,d deviates from
0.5, the smaller D becomes in case of a match, and the larger D
becomes in case of a mismatch, thereby generating stronger evidence
for accepting positive probes and stronger evidence for rejecting
negative probes. Therefore, the model meets the first requirement for
a successful model: symmetric evidence for matches and mismatches.
Importantly, the model also has the second critical feature, the ability
to limit comparison to relevant contexts. Due to the multiplicative
combination of the match values on the two dimensions, the model
implies to some degree the exclusion of items in irrelevant contexts.
Items associated to irrelevant contexts (i.e., items in different frames
than the probed one in local recognition, and items from the irrelevant
list in the modified Sternberg task) mismatch the probe on the context
dimension, thereby returning a low value of [1 – Dctx]. Whatever the
match of that episode on the item dimension, [1 – Ditem], it carries
little weight because it is multiplied with the low value on the context
dimension before being added to the global match signal.
This modified SP model predicts the serial position curves of the
two experiments much better than the original SP model. Illustrative predictions, with parameter settings tuned to the serial position
curves of positive probes, are presented on the left side of Figure
13 for local recognition and on the right side for the modified
Sternberg task.
There is one noticeable qualitative deviation of the predictions
from the data, however: For the modified Sternberg task the new
SP model predicts that performance on positive probes increases
with longer relevant lists. The opposite was found in Experiment
3. The reason for this misprediction is that with a short relevant
list, positive probes accumulate evidence for mismatch on the
context dimension from twice as many memory episodes—
namely, all four irrelevant-list items—than with a long relevant
list. Despite its relative success, the modified SP model makes this
one wrong prediction because it does not fully exclude the epi-

455

sodes from the irrelevant list from the comparison process. Specifically, whereas information from different dimensions within an
episode is integrated multiplicatively—thereby discounting evidence from one dimension when there is a mismatch on the
other—the matching signals across episodes are integrated additively, such that mismatch evidence grows linearly with the length
of the irrelevant list.
There is no obvious way to solve this problem within the
framework of SP models that base recognition decisions on a
global match value between the probe and all memory episodes.
One way out is to abandon global matching in favor of local
matching—that is, to compute a probe’s match only over the
relevant set of episodes. This is essentially what the recollection
process of the DP model does. A single-process model based only
on local matching could explain list-length and serial-position
effects, but it could not explain intrusion costs: When irrelevant
episodes are completely excluded from the comparison process,
intrusion probes are not harder to reject than new probes. I concluded that, although there is room within the general framework
of SP models for improving on the SP model I considered initially,
accounting for the whole pattern of data from both paradigms is a
challenge not easily met by any model from that family.
The two features identified as necessary to account for the
present data are the same as those identified as necessary to
explain another set of findings on short-term recognition (Oberauer & Lange, 2007). In that work we applied a version of the
present DP model to data from the modified Sternberg task with
nonwords as items. Memory was tested with a number of probe
types designed to distinguish memory for individual letters and
memory for their bindings. The ability of the DP model to exclude
irrelevant-list items from recollection, while at the same time being
sensitive to the familiarity arising from them, and the ability to
garner positive evidence for a mismatch as well as for a match,
proved critical for the DP model’s success in accounting for those
data. Thus, there is converging evidence from two sets of experiments for the two critical features of a successful model.

Three Sources of Recognition Information
The present findings not only help to identify challenges for SP
models of short-term recognition, they also place constraints on
DP models. The successful DP model I propose uses three sources
of information for a recognition decision: familiarity and the two
retrieval routes of recollection. Can we reduce this account to two
sources of information?
One possibility to consider is that item-to-context retrieval is
unnecessary to explain the data. The evidence for this process is
the serial position curve for intrusion probes when plotted by
position of origin, displaying primacy and recency effects. In
principle, such a serial position curve could arise from position
effects of familiarity. If, for some reason, items at the beginning
and the end of a list are less familiar than those in the middle, then
it would be more difficult to overcome the misleading familiarity
of intrusion probes stemming from middle list position than that of
intrusion probes from the primacy and the recency part of the list.
There is, however, no reason to assume that items in the primacy
and recency part of a list elicit a weaker familiarity signal. If
anything, the primacy and recency effects on acceptance of positive probes suggest the opposite. The item-to-context retrieval

hypothesis, in contrast, affords an explanation that can be applied
equally to all serial position curves reported in this article: Bindings between items and their contexts are stronger at the beginning
and end of a list than in the middle, and this strength is symmetrical for item-to-context retrieval and for context-to-item retrieval.
The same explanation would also apply for cued recall, which
generates similar serial position curves (Oberauer, 2003). Why
bindings are stronger in the primacy and recency portion is a
question for future research.
A second possibility to reduce the DP model to just two sources of
information would be to eliminate familiarity assessment as a separate
process and explain intrusion costs through item-to-context retrieval
instead, as follows: Successful retrieval of a context for a probe would
result in high familiarity, whereas failure would result in low familiarity. Positive and intrusion probes would both be highly familiar
because they are associated with a context in the current list. New
probes could at best serve to retrieve older contexts (e.g., previous lists
in the experiment or extra-experimental contexts), and the associations to these contexts can be assumed to have weakened over time,

so that retrieving the context of a new probe results in lower familiarity. This account of intrusion costs, however, faces the same problem as the SP theory. It predicts that intrusion costs should be larger
for probes that are strongly associated to their contexts than for probes
weakly associated to their contexts, because strongly associated
probes generate more misleading familiarity. The U-shaped serial
position curves over position of origin would then imply that intrusion
probes from the middle of the list are more strongly bound to their
contexts than are probes from the primacy or recency portion. This
assumption cannot be ruled out, but it makes it difficult to explain
why serial position curves for positive probes show higher hit rates in
the primacy and recency portion. If familiarity is stronger for items in
the middle position by virtue of stronger item-to-context associations,
the only way that primacy and recency items could attract higher hit
rates is for them to have much stronger context-to-item associations
than those in the middle. This would mean that the strength of
context-to-item associations is inversely related across serial positions
to the strength of item-to-context associations. I think this is a very
implausible assumption.

SHORT-TERM RECOGNITION

The present DP model is tailored to short-term recognition tasks
in which typically short lists are presented, for which recollection
of the complete list is feasible. Recollection1 relied on the ability
to retrieve all items associated with the relevant list context—
which in most paradigms is the whole list presented for the current
trial—to ascertain for negative probes that they do not match any
of them. Researchers interested in recognition from long-term
memory usually ask people to learn much longer lists than those
used in the present experiments, and learning is often separated
from the test phase by a filled delay. I assume that with increasing
length of the relevant list and increasing delay between study and
test, people rely less on context-to-item recollection. In the limit,
recollection should consist entirely of item-to-context recollection
(i.e., Recollection2). One prediction arising from this assumption is
that list-length effects should flatten out in the longer range,
because the contribution of the list-length parameter C, which is
mediated through Recollection1, diminishes with increasing list
length. In fact, the slope of RTs over list length flattens out as list
length is increased from 2 to 20 (Burrows & Okada, 1975; Okada
& Burrows, 1978).

Conclusion
In conclusion, the present data provide strong evidence for a
dual-process theory of recognition over short time intervals. This
conclusion converges with a wealth of research using primarily
recognition over longer intervals, which also points toward two
processes of recognition (Diana et al., 2006). In addition, the
present experiments identified two retrieval routes that contribute
to recollection. One route retrieves the item or items associated to
the probed context, and the other route retrieves the context associated to the probe item.

Diffusion Model for Predicting Accuracy and Reaction
Time
In the diffusion model, a decision between two responses is
made by an evidence accumulator that gradually drifts with rate v
toward one of two decision boundaries until it hits one of the
boundaries, on which the corresponding response is made. The
separation between the two boundaries is denoted a. By convention, the upper boundary represents the correct response and the
lower boundary the incorrect response. RT is the time until the
accumulator hits the boundary, plus a nondecisional component
Ter representing sensory and motor processing time. In my application to recognition, drift rate is computed as follows:
v ⫽ q共m ⫺ ␶兲

(A1)

v ⫽ ⫺q共m ⫺ ␶兲

(A2)

distance on the context dimension is 0, and the distance on the item
dimension is 1. The similarity value for position p therefore equals
exp(⫺cu), and the resulting global match integrating across all
positions is as follows:

Here, s represents the standard deviation of diffusion noise, which
is set to 0.1, following common practice in applications of the
diffusion model.

Predictions From the Single-Process Model for the
Modified Sternberg Task
The probe is compared to all episodes in the relevant and in the
irrelevant list. Positive items match one episode on both dimensions. In addition, they match the other episodes of the relevant list
on the context dimension (i.e., the color), and they have minimum
similarity to the episodes of the irrelevant list. The match value for
a positive probe in list position p can be written as follows:

冘

n共rel兲

mpos,p ⫽ Sp ⫹

Positive probes match exactly one episode with regard to both
content and position, returning a similarity value of 1. Similarity to
all other items equals exp(⫺c). We can therefore write the degree
of match of a positive probe presented in list position p and tested
at test position t as:

The last of the three terms in this expression is typically a very
small value, so that the global match value of an intrusion probe is
determined by the strength of the position of origin, So,t, and the
strength of the probed position, Sp,t.

Intrusion probes match the episode in the probed position p on the
position dimension and the episode in the probe’s position of
origin o on the item identity dimension. Thus, the overall match of
an intrusion probe includes the similarity on the item dimension,
exp[⫺c(1⫺u)], times the strength term for o, and the similarity on
the position dimension, exp(⫺cu), times the strength term for p:

for positive probes, and

for negative probes.
Parameter ␶ is the decision criterion for m; a drift toward
accepting the probe is elicited if m ⬎ ␶; q is a scaling parameter
determining overall performance of the model. For negative
probes, accepting the probe is the incorrect response, and therefore
the term for computing drift rate must be multiplied with ⫺1 so
that a drift toward false alarms is represented by a negative drift
rate, and a drift toward correct rejection is represented by a
positive drift rate. The mean RT of correct responses and the
proportion correct (PC) are given by the following:

Intrusion probes match one episode in position o of the irrelevant
list on the item dimension. In addition, they match n(rel) episodes
in the relevant list on the context dimension, and they match the
remaining irrelevant-list episodes on no dimension. Their match
therefore equals the following:

Here, o refers to the probe’s position of origin in the irrelevant list.

recognition; serial position runs from 1 to 6 throughout the whole
list.

Predictions of the Dual-Process Model for Local
Recognition
For positive probes, probed position and position of origin are
the same. Therefore, applying Equations A9 to A11 to positive
probes yields the following:

distinguishing between different functions describing list length
effects, so I chose an exponential decline of strength with list
length purely for convenience. The resulting equation for S1, the
strength of Recollection1 is the following:
S1i ⫽ 共1 ⫺ C兲 n共rel兲⫺1 䡠 共Pi⫺1 ⫹ Rn⫺1 兲,

(A15)

For a new probe, Recollection1 generates a negative signal with
strength Sp,t. Recollection2 fails to retrieve a context matching the
probed frame returns ⫺1 with unit weight. Thus,

with C as a free parameter governing the list length effect, i as the
serial position in the total series of six items, n(rel) as the list
length of the relevant list, and n as the length of the total series
(i.e., 6). For Recollection2, strength S2 is computed as in local
recognition. To summarize, the equations for recollection are as
follows:

For an intrusion probe, Recollection1 generates ⫺1 with a strength
equal to Sp,t. Recollection2 returns ⫺1 with the strength of the
position of origin, So,t. Thus, overall recollection for intrusion
probes equals
