A crowd often possesses better information than do the individuals it comprises. For example, if people are asked to guess
the weight of a prize-winning ox (Galton, 1907), the error of the
average response is substantially smaller than the average error
of individual estimates. This fact, which Galton interpreted as
support for democratic governance, is responsible for the success of polling the audience in the television program ‘‘Who
Wants to be a Millionaire’’ (Surowiecki, 2004) and for the superiority of combined over individual ﬁnancial forecasts (Clemen,
1989). Researchers agree that this wisdom-of-crowds effect depends on a statistical fact: The crowd’s average will be more
accurate as long as some of the error of one individual is statistically independent of the error of other individuals—as
seems almost guaranteed to be the case.
Whether a similar improvement can be obtained by averaging
two estimates from a single individual is not, a priori, obvious. If
one estimate represents the best information available to the
person, as common intuition suggests, then a second guess will
simply add noise, and averaging the two will only decrease accuracy. Researchers have previously assumed this view and
focused on improving the best estimate (Hirt & Markman, 1995;
Mussweiler, Strack, & Pfeiffer, 2000; Stewart, 2001).
Alternatively, initial estimates may represent samples drawn
from an internal probability distribution, rather than deterministic best guesses. According to this account, the average of
two estimates from one person will be more accurate than a
single estimate, so long as the noise contained in the two estimates is at least somewhat independent. Ariely et al. (2000)
predicted that such a beneﬁt would accrue from averaging
probability judgments within one individual, but did not ﬁnd
evidence of such an effect. However, probability judgments are
known to be biased toward extreme values (0 or 1), and averaging should not reduce the bias of estimates; if guesses are
sampled from an unbiased distribution, however, averaging

should reduce error (variance; Laplace, 1812/1878; Wallsten,
Budescu, Erev, & Diederich, 1997).
Probabilistic representations have been postulated in recent
models of memory (Steyvers, Grifﬁths, & Dennis, 2006), perception (Kersten & Yuille, 2003), and neural coding (Ma, Beck,
Latham, & Pouget, 2006). It is consistent with such models that
responses of many people are distributed probabilistically, as
shown by the wisdom-of-crowds effect. However, despite the theoretical appeal of these models, there has been scant evidence
that, within a given person, knowledge is represented as a probability distribution. Finding any beneﬁt of averaging two responses
from one person would yield support for this hypothesis.
METHOD

We recruited 428 participants from an Internet-based subject
pool and asked them eight questions probing their real-world
knowledge (derived from The World Factbook, Central Intelligence Agency, 2007; e.g., ‘‘What percentage of the world’s airports are in the United States?’’). Participants were instructed
to guess the correct answers. Half the participants were unexpectedly asked to make a second, different guess for each
question immediately after completing the questionnaire (immediate condition); the other half made a second guess 3 weeks
later (delayed condition), also without being given advance notice that they would be answering the questions a second time. It is
important that neither group knew they would be required to furnish a second guess, as this precluded subjects from misinterpreting their task as being to specify the two endpoints of a range.
RESULTS

The average of two guesses from one individual (within-person
average) was more accurate (lower mean squared error) than
either guess alone (see Fig. 1a). In the immediate condition, the
error of the average was smaller than the error of the ﬁrst guess,
t(254) 5 2.25, p < .05, and of the second guess, t(254) 5 6.08,
p < .01. In the delayed condition, the error of the average was
also smaller than the error of the ﬁrst guess, t(172) 5 3.94,

Fig. 1. Experimental results. The bar graph (a) presents mean squared error for the ﬁrst and second guesses and their average, as a function of
condition (immediate vs. 3-week delay). The line graph (b) shows mean squared error as a function of number of guesses averaged together. The data
points show results for guesses from independent subjects (blue), a single subject in the immediate condition (red), and a single subject in the delayed
condition (green). The blue curve shows convergence to the population bias, which is indicated by the horizontal blue line (the error of the guess
averaged across all people). Through interpolation (black lines), we computed the value of two guesses from one person relative to two guesses from
independent people, for both the immediate and the delayed conditions. The shaded regions are bootstrapped 90% conﬁdence intervals. Error bars
represent standard errors of the means.

p < .01, and of the second guess, t(172) 5 6.59, p < .01. This
result indicates that subjects did not produce a second guess
by simply perturbing the ﬁrst; rather, the error of the two guesses
was somewhat independent. This beneﬁt of averaging cannot
be attributed to subjects’ ﬁnding more information between
guesses, because second guesses were less accurate than ﬁrst
guesses (see Fig. 1a) in both the immediate condition, t(254) 5
3.6, p < .01, and the delayed condition, t(172) 5 2.8, p < .01.
Moreover, the beneﬁt of averaging was greater when the second
guess was delayed by 3 weeks than when it was immediate;
that is, the difference in error between the ﬁrst guess and the
average was greater in the delayed condition than in the immediate condition, t(426) 5 2.12, p < .05. The 95% conﬁdence
intervals for percentage of error reduced relative to the ﬁrst
guess were [2.5%, 10.4%] in the immediate condition and
[11.6%, 20.4%] in the delayed condition. Thus, one beneﬁts
from polling the ‘‘crowd’’ within, and the inner crowd grows
more effective (independent) when more time elapses between
guesses.
We compared the efﬁcacy of within-person averaging and
across-person averaging via hyperbolic interpolation (see Fig. 1b).
The error of the average guess across all people corresponds
to the bias of the distribution of beliefs in the population.
According to the central limit theorem, if different subjects’
deviations from the group bias are independent, the mean
squared error of the average of N guesses from N people should

be a hyperbola that converges to the group bias as N goes to
inﬁnity. This hyperbola ﬁts the across-person averages perfectly
(R2 5 1). However, N guesses from one person are not as beneﬁcial as N guesses from N people. The reduction in mean
squared error from averaging N guesses from one person can be
described as 1/[1 1 l(N 1)], where l is the proportion of an
additional guess from another person that an additional guess
from the same person is worth; when l is 1, averaging in a second
guess from the same person confers the same beneﬁt as averaging in a second guess from a different person; when l is 0,
averaging in a second guess from the same person confers no
beneﬁt at all. The value of l can be estimated by interpolating
the beneﬁt of within-person averaging onto the hyperbola representing the beneﬁt of across-person averaging. Thus, we
computed how many different-person guesses one would need to
average together to attain the same error as in the average of two
guesses from one person. This value is 1.11 (l 5 0.11) for two
immediate guesses and 1.32 (l 5 0.32) for two delayed guesses.
Simply put, you can gain about 1/10th as much from asking
yourself the same question twice as you can from getting a
second opinion from someone else, but if you wait 3 weeks, the
beneﬁt of reasking yourself the same question rises to 1/3 the
value of a second opinion. One potential explanation of the cost
of immediacy is that subjects are biased by their ﬁrst response
to produce less independent samples (a delay mitigates this
anchoring effect).

DISCUSSION

Although people assume that their ﬁrst guess about a matter of
fact exhausts the best information available to them, a forced
second guess contributes additional information, such that the
average of two guesses is better than either guess alone. This
observed beneﬁt of averaging multiple responses from the same
person suggests that responses made by a subject are sampled
from an internal probability distribution, rather than deterministically selected on the basis of all the knowledge a subject has.
Temporal separation of guesses increases the beneﬁt of
within-person averaging by increasing the independence of
guesses, thus making a second guess from the same person more
like a guess from a completely different individual. Beyond
having theoretical implications about the probabilistic nature of
knowledge, these results suggest that the beneﬁt of averaging
two guesses from one individual can serve as a quantitative measure of the beneﬁt of ‘‘sleeping on it.’’
