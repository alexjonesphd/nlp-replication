A Needs-Based Model of Reconciliation: Satisfying the Differential
Emotional Needs of Victim and Perpetrator as a Key to Promoting
Reconciliation
Nurit Shnabel and Arie Nadler
Tel Aviv University
The authors propose that conflict threatens different psychological resources of victims and perpetrators
and that these threats contribute to the maintenance of conflict (A. Nadler, 2002; A. Nadler & I. Liviatan,
2004; A. Nadler & N. Shnabel, in press). On the basis of this general proposition, the authors developed
a needs-based model of reconciliation that posits that being a victim is associated with a threat to one’s
status and power, whereas being a perpetrator threatens one’s image as moral and socially acceptable. To
counter these threats, victims must restore their sense of power, whereas perpetrators must restore their
public moral image. A social exchange interaction in which these threats are removed should enhance the
parties’ willingness to reconcile. The results of 4 studies on interpersonal reconciliation support these
hypotheses. Applied and theoretical implications of this model are discussed.
Keywords: reconciliation, conflict resolution, emotional needs, victims, perpetrators

termed by Nadler (2002) the socio-emotional route to reconciliation. One major way these emotional barriers can be removed is
through the apology–forgiveness cycle (Tavuchis, 1991), that is,
when a perpetrator apologizes to the victim and when the victim
reciprocates by granting forgiveness.
The processes of socio-emotional reconciliation has received
little attention in social psychology research, and the few studies
devoted to this subject have mostly explored factors at the intrapersonal level. Some of these have included attention to affective
states (e.g., feeling empathy toward the offender; McCullough,
Worthington, & Rachal, 1997) and personality traits (e.g., psychological femininity; McCullough et al., 1998). Others have focused
on how parties to a conflict perceive the relationship between them
(e.g., perceived quality of alternatives) or the profitability of maintaining the relationship (Rusbult, 1983; Rusbult & Van Lange,
1996; Rusbult, Verette, Whitney, Slovik, & Lipkus, 1991). Consequently, these studies focused on only one side of the conflict
(i.e., either on the perpetrator or the victim) and thus have overlooked the interaction between the victim and the perpetrator and
the role of this interaction in promoting interpersonal reconciliation. The present research seeks to amend this shortcoming by
proposing a model of reconciliation as the outcome of the simultaneous and reciprocal satisfaction of the emotional needs of the
perpetrator and the victim.

The study of conflict and its resolution has generated much
theoretical and empirical interest in the last few decades (Jones,
1998; Pruitt, 1998). Most of the research in this field is based on
the realist approach to conflict and its resolution, according to
which disputes between persons and groups are grounded in conflicts over material interests (Scheff, 1994). Consequently, most of
the literature in this field assumes that conflicts are resolved once
the relevant parties are able to agree on a formula for redistributing
contested resources. In the present article, we focus on reconciliation between opponents as distinguished from conflict resolution.
Reconciliation, in contrast to conflict resolution, “must include a
changed psychological orientation towards the other” (Staub,
Pearlman, Gubin, & Hagengimana, 2005, p. 301) and may occur
only once the parties have resolved the emotional issues that may
have left them estranged (Nadler, 2002; Nadler & Liviatan, 2006).
Theories of reconciliation stress that an end to a conflict cannot
be achieved merely by satisfying the instrumental motivations of
opponents (such as the motivation to maximize one’s outcomes;
Rusbult & Van Lange, 1996). Instead, satisfying the emotional
needs of the parties (such as the need to take revenge; Frijda, 1994)
is necessary as well. Similarly, theoreticians of negotiation stress
that although focusing on tangible issues such as money or property and ignoring intangible issues that relate to the psychological
needs of the adversaries is a common practice, it often deadlocks
the negotiation (Zubek, Pruitt, Peirce, McGillicuddy, & Syna,
1992). In other words, as long as these emotional needs remain
unsatisfied, they block the path to reconciliation. The process of
satisfying these emotional needs that impede reconciliation was

Reconciliation as an Act of Social Exchange
The needs-based model of reconciliation is predicated on the
idea that following an episode in which one side has been victimized by another, both the victim and the perpetrator are deprived of
certain unique psychological resources. This deprivation brings
about different emotional needs in victims and in perpetrators, and
until these needs are satisfied they serve as barriers to reconciliation. Actions that satisfy the differential needs of victims and
perpetrators (such as granting forgiveness or offering an apology)

NEEDS-BASED MODEL OF RECONCILIATION

facilitate the recovery of the parties’ impaired psychological resources and thus promote their willingness to reconcile. In this
manner, socio-emotional reconciliation can be framed as an act of
social exchange: Reconciliation is facilitated when victims and
perpetrators receive needed emotional “commodities” through
postconflict interactions.
In a victimization episode, the impairment to the psychological
resources of victims and perpetrators is asymmetrical. Victims feel
inferior regarding their power (Foster & Rusbult, 1999), honor
(Scheff, 1994), self-esteem (Scobie & Scobie, 1998), and perceived control (Baumeister, Stillwell, & Heatherton, 1994) and
may experience feelings of victimization or anger (McCullough et
al., 1998). In contrast, perpetrators suffer from moral inferiority
(Exline & Baumeister, 2000; Zechmeister & Romero, 2002) and
may feel guilt (Baumeister et al., 1994), shame (Exline &
Baumeister, 2000), or repentance (North, 1998). This myriad of
emotional states has been said to reflect the perpetrators’ “anxiety
over social exclusion” (Baumeister et. al., 1994, p. 246) because
they face the threat of being rejected from the moral community to
which they belong (Tavuchis, 1991).
From a broader perspective, these impaired emotional resources
can be subsumed under the human need for power and the human
need for love and belonging, two needs that constitute the core of
interpersonal experience (Bennis & Shepard, 1956). Using the
terminology of resources theory, which classifies the resources that
are exchanged in social interactions into six categories (love,
status, services, goods, information, and money; Foa & Foa, 1980),
we suggest that the resource that is threatened in victims falls into
the category of status (i.e., the need for relative power), whereas
the resource that is threatened for perpetrators is associated with
the category of love (i.e., the need for relatedness).
Deprivation of the above resources leads to a corresponding
motivational state in which the individual experiences his or her
deprivation as a need that must be fulfilled. For victims, this
emerges as an enhanced need to restore their sense of power and
an increase in power-seeking behavior (Foster & Rusbult, 1999).
To achieve this goal, victims are likely to want perpetrators to
acknowledge their responsibility for the injustice that they have
caused. This acknowledgement creates a kind of “debt” that only
the victim can cancel, and thus returns control to the hands of the
victim, who may then determine whether the perpetrator will be
forgiven and reaccepted into the moral community (Akhtar, 2002;
Minow, 1998; Schönbach, 1990). For this reason, victims often try
to induce guilt among perpetrators: Perpetrators’ guilt serves as an
admission of the debt they owe victims (Baumeister et al., 1994).
The perpetrator, unlike the victim, exercises more power and
control during the victimization episode. Nevertheless, when perpetrators are accused of violating conventional moral standards or
deviating from group norms, they may fear exclusion from the
designated moral community to which they belong (Tavuchis,
1991). The anxiety over social exclusion increases perpetrators’
motivation to perceive themselves as acceptable people (Baumeister, Stillwell, & Wotman, 1990) as well as their need to have others
express understanding and empathy regarding the circumstances
that compelled them to act in a socially unacceptable way (Nadler
& Liviatan, 2004, 2006) and empathy for their emotional distress
(McCullough et al., 1997). This understanding, in turn, restores
perpetrators’ public moral image (i.e., their sense of being perceived as moral individuals) and helps them feel “rehumanized”

117

(Staub et al., 2005). Empathy and understanding for the perpetrator’s perspective are therefore a kind of “gift” that victims give to
those who have offended them, which culminates in their explicitly
granting forgiveness (Enright, Freedman, & Rique, 1998). Forgiveness mitigates the moral inferiority engendered by the role of
perpetrators (Exline & Baumeister, 2000) and is a reassurance that
they belong to the moral community to which their membership
was questioned.
In line with this reasoning, Carlsmith and Gross (1969) reported
that participants who delivered an electric shock to a confederate
tended to offer more help to the confederate following the experiment than those who did not deliver the shock. This behavior may
be interpreted as a reaction by perpetrators aimed at balancing the
impairment to their resource of love (Foa & Foa, 1980).
The impairment to the perpetrators’ resource of love consists of
a threat to their moral image in the eyes of relevant others (i.e.,
threat to public moral image) rather than to their feelings of guilt.
Research that indicates that victims and perpetrators have different
perspectives on the same victimization episode is consistent with
the idea that concerns about one’s moral image may be disassociated from perpetrators’ guilt. In fact, while perpetrators are
concerned as to whether others view them as moral actors, they
often avoid feelings of guilt by minimizing the moral implications
of their actions or by denying responsibility for them (Mikula,
2002); in fact, even actions that seem senselessly cruel may be
perceived by perpetrators as having at least some redeeming purpose or merit (Baumeister, 1996). This contrasts with victims’
tendency to emphasize the injustice that they suffered and the
perpetrator’s responsibility for it. This phenomenon, labeled by
Exline and Baumeister (2000) as the magnitude gap underscores
the idea that the impairment to perpetrator’s resource of love,
which is posited in our model, reflects a threat to perpetrators’
moral image that is relatively independent of their feelings of guilt.
When a successful social exchange takes place between victim
and perpetrator, both sides satisfy their emotional needs and cease
to feel weaker than or morally inferior to their counterpart. This
generates a process of symbolic erasure of the roles of victim and
perpetrator, which places the involved parties on a more equal
footing (North, 1998) and thus leads to a greater willingness to
reconcile with one’s opponent (cf. Nadler & Shnabel, in press).
The progress of the socio-emotional route to reconciliation is
summarized in Figure 1.
The present research was designed to test this model. The first
two hypotheses center on the psychological resources that are
impaired in the victim and the perpetrator and the needs that result
from this impairment. The third and fourth hypotheses focus on the
way in which messages of empowerment and acceptance affect
victims’ and perpetrators’ views of themselves and their subsequent willingness to reconcile. Accordingly, the major hypotheses
are as follows:
Hypothesis 1: For victims, the primary psychological resource that is impaired following a victimization episode is
their sense of power, whereas for perpetrators, the primary
impairment is to their public moral image (i.e., their perception that others view them as being relatively immoral).
Hypothesis 2: This differential impairment elicits different
emotional needs: Perpetrators will express a stronger need for

social acceptance (i.e., that victims should try to understand
and accept their perspective), whereas victims will express a
stronger need for power.
Hypothesis 3: After receiving a message of empowerment
from perpetrators, victims will perceive themselves as more
powerful. After receiving a message of acceptance, perpetrators will perceive that others view them as relatively more
moral (i.e., will have a higher public moral image).
Hypothesis 4: Restoring victims’ sense of power will enhance
their willingness to reconcile with perpetrators. Similarly,
restoring perpetrators’ public moral image will enhance their
willingness to reconcile with victims.
We conducted four studies to test these hypotheses. The first
two studies used laboratory experiments: Study 1 tested Hypotheses 1 and 2 (these hypotheses were also tested in naturally occurring situations, in a study briefly described in the
Discussion section of Study 1), and Study 2 tested Hypotheses 3 and 4. Study 3 again tested Hypotheses 3 and 4 by using
vignettes describing real-life situations. Finally, Study 4 used
vignettes in a role-playing methodology to test the whole
model (Hypotheses 1– 4).

Study 1
The first study was designed to test the first part of our theoretical model: In the course of an offense, victims primarily experience an impairment to their psychological resource of power and
consequently have a stronger need to restore power. By contrast,
perpetrators primarily experience an impairment to their psychological resource of moral worth and hence have a higher need for
social acceptance. Unlike past research on victim–perpetrator relations that has investigated this topic through the use of roleplaying techniques (e.g., Foster & Rusbult, 1999) or recall of
relevant life situations (e.g., McCullough et al., 1997), we chose a
laboratory setting to test our hypotheses. The use of the experi-

mental method allowed us to randomly assign participants to the
victim or perpetrator role in the same controlled social situation.
This created two major methodological challenges: The first was
to provide a cover story that was ethically sound, given that
classical paradigms that produce victims and perpetrators such as
the teacher–student paradigm (Milgram, 1974) or the jail paradigm
(Haney, Banks, & Zimbardo, 1973) are unacceptable. The second
was to have all participants in the perpetrator condition hurt their
victim and believe that they had done so of their own volition. The
experimental design was a 2 ⫻ 2 between-subjects design: Role
(victim vs. perpetrator) ⫻ Condition (experimental vs. control).

Method
Participants
Participants (N ⫽ 103) were 81 female and 22 male university
undergraduates (age: M ⫽ 23 years), who were paid for their
participation. Men and women were represented in equal proportion in the four experimental cells.

Procedure
The experiment was described as a study being conducted by the
International Advertising Association (IAA) in collaboration with
Tel Aviv University Business School. All instructions and procedures were computerized.
Participants were told that they would take part in a “creativity
test” meant to identify participants who had a high potential to
work in the advertising industry. To enhance the value of success
on the creativity test, participants were told that if they succeeded
on the test they could advance to a second and rewarding phase of
the study.
Participants were then randomly assigned to be either “writers”
or “judges.” The writers’ task was to write slogans for a list of
products that were presented to them, and the judges’ task was to
evaluate these slogans. To advance to the second phase of the
study, writers had to achieve an average score of at least 85. Judges
were told that their advancement to the second phase depended on
an assessment by an IAA representative of the quality of their
judgment and their ability to evaluate creativity potential. To
maintain a high level of psychological relevance of the interaction
with the partner, all participants were led to believe that after the
test they would have to work together with their partner on a
common task.
Judges in the experimental condition were advised to be strict in
their evaluations and to judge the slogans by real-world standards,
whereas judges in the control condition were advised to be lenient
and regard the slogans as preliminary drafts. It was stressed that
following this advice for lenient or strict assessments of the slogans would increase the judges’ chances of passing to the next
phase of the experiment, which was presented as highly rewarding.
Thus, judges in both conditions were free to choose which grades
to give their partners, but in the experimental condition they knew
that being too nice to their partner might harm their chances of
moving to the next and rewarding phase of the experiment. As a
result of these instructions, judges in the experimental condition
gave their partners lower grades, and the experimenter later informed them that the writers had failed the test due their harsh

NEEDS-BASED MODEL OF RECONCILIATION

evaluations. Judges in the control condition gave their partners
higher grades, and the experimenter later informed these judges
that despite their positive evaluations, the IAA committee declined
to advance the writer to the second phase due to external considerations. Writers in the experimental condition received low scores
from their partners throughout the exam and consequently failed
the test, whereas writers in the control condition received relatively
higher scores from their partners but were informed that they failed
the test due to the decision of the IAA representatives.
Afterward, the experimenter asked participants to complete
questionnaires, which included the dependent measures. These
were presented as a standard feedback procedure required by the
university’s ethics committee. Upon completion, participants were
thanked and debriefed.

averaged to obtain a single measure of need for power (Cronbach’s
␣ ⫽ .95).
Five 7-point scale items measured participants’ need for social
acceptance: I would like. . . (a) to explain my considerations during
the task to my partner, (b) my partner to understand the reasons
for my behavior, (c) my partner to know that I tried to act fairly
during the test, (d) my partner to know that I did not act out of
thoughtlessness, and (e) my partner to understand that I am not a
harsh person. Ratings for the five items were averaged to obtain a
single measure of need for social acceptance (Cronbach’s ␣ ⫽
.89). The dependent variables above were used in identical form in
the subsequent studies, except for minor adjustments in wording
that were made to suit the different experimental contexts.

Results
Measures
The questionnaire included (a) manipulation checks, (b) a measure of sense of power, (c) a measure of public moral image, and
(d) measures of need for power and need for social acceptance.
Manipulation checks. Participants were asked to indicate on a
7-point scale the degree to which they (a) were offended by their
partner, (b) felt that their partner had caused them injustice, (c)
offended their partner, or (d) felt that they had caused their partner
injustice. Ratings for the first two items were highly correlated
(r ⫽ .85) and were averaged to obtain a single measure of victimhood. Ratings for the third and fourth items were also highly
correlated (r ⫽ .86) and were averaged to obtain a single measure
of perpetration.
Sense of power. Three 7-point scale items measured participants’ self-perception of power: (a) During the interaction with my
partner, I felt relatively weak to I felt relatively strong; (b) I did not
have a lot of influence on the interaction with my partner to I had
a lot of influence; and (c) I had the lower hand to I had the upper
hand. Another three items measured the public image of power
(i.e., the extent to which participants thought their partners viewed
them as powerful): My partner perceives me as. . . (a) relatively
weak to relatively strong, (b) not having a lot of control over the
interaction between us to having a lot of control, and (c) having
relatively low influence on the interaction to relatively high influence. Ratings for the 6 items were averaged to obtain a single
measure of sense of power (Cronbach’s ␣ ⫽ .92).
Public moral image. Three 7-point scale items measured participants’ public moral image (i.e., the extent to which participants
believed that their partners viewed them as moral): My partner
perceives. . . (a) me as not being completely moral to me as being
completely moral, (b) my behavior as not 100% appropriate to my
behavior as 100% appropriate, and (c) my behavior as not ethically flawless to my behavior as ethically flawless. Ratings for the
three items were averaged to obtain a single measure of public
moral image (Cronbach’s ␣ ⫽ .92).
Emotional needs. Four 7-point scale items measured participants’ need for power: I would like to. . . (a) have more influence
on the test and its procedure, (b) have more power in the role to
which I was assigned, (c) increase my level of control over the
interaction between myself and my partner, and (d) have more say
during joint work. Participants rated these items from 1 (not
particularly) to 7 (very much). Ratings for the four items were

p ⬍ .001; means were 5.61 and 4.03, respectively.1 This finding is
consistent with our prediction regarding perpetrators’ emotional
needs.

Discussion
In general, the results of Study 1 support our theoretical model.
First, the manipulation was successful in producing perpetrators
and victims: Judges in the experimental condition perceived themselves as perpetrators to a greater extent than did the participants
in the other three conditions, and writers in the experimental
condition perceived themselves as victims to a greater extent than
did the participants in the other three conditions. Furthermore, our
predictions regarding most of the dependent variables were supported: For victims, the primary psychological resource that was
impaired was their sense of power, and for perpetrators, the primary impairment was to their public moral image. The results also
supported our predictions that the differential impairment of psychological resources would elicit different emotional needs: Victims expressed a stronger need for power, whereas perpetrators
expressed a stronger need for social acceptance (i.e., wanting
victims to understand and accept their perspective).
However, there was one empirical inconsistency with our predictions that needs to be considered. The unpredicted finding was
that writers in the experimental condition expressed a higher need
for social acceptance compared with writers in the control condition. This finding does not contradict our theoretical model (because perpetrators nevertheless exhibited the greatest need for
social acceptance). Because the victims’ need for social acceptance
was related to their need for power (these two measures were
strongly correlated, r ⫽ .37, p ⬍ .01), it is possible that victims felt
that if they could spell out their perspectives to perpetrators, the
perpetrators would realize the extent of their wrongdoing and
would try to compensate them for this mistreatment.

Here, as well as in all other t tests reported in this article, we conducted
Levene’s test for homogeneity of variances and decided whether to assume
equal variances accordingly. For the sake of brevity, we do not report the
results of the Levene’s tests, but these can be deduced by the reported
degrees of freedom of the t tests.

NEEDS-BASED MODEL OF RECONCILIATION

In order to extend the generalizability and external validity of
our findings, we tested the same hypotheses in a real-world context. Participants in this study were 107 university undergraduates
who were instructed to recall a situation in which they had hurt a
significant other (perpetrator condition) or were hurt by a significant other (victim condition). Following this, participants were
asked to complete a questionnaire that assessed (a) self-ratings of
power, (b) public moral image, and (c) emotional needs (i.e., the
needs for power and social acceptance). The results replicated the
findings of Study 1: Victims perceived themselves as weaker than
perpetrators and exhibited a higher need for power, whereas perpetrators perceived themselves as having an inferior public moral
image compared with victims and exhibited a higher need for
social acceptance.2 Taken together, the findings of both studies
support the first part of our theoretical model, which asserts that in
a victim–perpetrator interaction different psychological resources
are impaired for victims and perpetrators and that this leads to the
arousal of different emotional needs.

Study 2
Study 2 tested the second part of our model, which asserts that
satisfying the differential emotional needs of victims and perpetrators will facilitate reconciliation between them in the setting of
a laboratory experiment. The experiment used the experimental
condition of the creativity test paradigm used in Study 1, which
was proven effective in producing victims and perpetrators. Half of
the participants were randomly assigned to the victim condition
(i.e., writer) and the other half were assigned to the perpetrator
condition (i.e., judge). At the end of the session (i.e., after they
were informed of their success or failure in passing to the next
phase), participants received messages allegedly sent by their
partners. The content of the message emphasized either social
acceptance or empowerment or neither social acceptance nor empowerment (i.e., the control condition). Thus, the experimental
design was a 2 ⫻ 3 between-subjects design: Role (victim vs.
perpetrator) ⫻ Message (empowerment vs. acceptance vs. control). We hypothesized that messages emphasizing empowerment
would render victims readier to reconcile, whereas messages emphasizing acceptance would render perpetrators readier to reconcile.

Method
Participants
Participants (N ⫽ 184) were 140 female and 44 male university
undergraduates (age: M ⫽ 23.5 years), who took part in the
experiment in fulfillment of a course credit. Men and women were
represented in equal proportion in the six experimental cells.

Procedure
After inducing the victim and perpetrator conditions via the
creativity test procedure (see Study 1), participants were told that
because they and their partner would be working as a team in a
later part of the experiment, they would now be asked to exchange
structured feedback with each other. Participants completed the
feedback form electronically and ostensibly exchanged feedback
with their partner by pressing a Send or Receive button.3

121

This feedback consisted of ratings on two subscales, each containing four items. The first subscale rated the participants’ competence on four measures (talent, creativity, originality, and quality
of ideas), and the second subscale rated the partners’ agreeableness
and interpersonal skills (the extent to which the participant was
perceived as kind, agreeable, pleasant to work with, and having
good social skills). The manipulation of empowerment through
competence feedback and acceptance through feedback on agreeableness and interpersonal skills is consistent with Foa and Foa’s
(1980) resource theory as well as with research in the field of
empowerment, which treats competence as one of its components
(Brookings & Bolton, 2000; Menson & Hartmann, 2002; Vardi,
2000; Yiannakis & Melnick, 2001), and research in the field of
agreeableness, which associates this trait with the feeling of being
accepted by others (Buckley, Winkel, & Leary, 2004). On the
empirical level, the competence feedback was designed to increase
participants’ sense of power, and the feedback was aimed at
increasing their public moral image; these manipulations were
successful in inducing the intended psychological effects.
In the empowerment condition, participants received feedback
implying that they were perceived by their partners as very competent and creative (receiving an average competence score of 6.5)
but mediocre on agreeableness (receiving an average agreeableness score of 3.5); in the acceptance condition, the partners’
feedback implied that they perceived the participant as very agreeable (receiving an average agreeableness score of 6.5) but mediocre in terms of competence (receiving an average competence
score of 3.5). In the control condition, the partners’ feedback
implied that participants were perceived as mediocre on competence and agreeableness (both average scores were 3.5). After
participants finished reading the feedback, they were asked to fill
in the dependent measure questionnaire in a manner similar to
Study 1 (assessing the manipulation checks as well as the dependent variables: sense of power, public moral image, and willingness to reconcile with the partner).4 Upon completion, participants
were thanked and debriefed.

Measures
Manipulation checks. In order to assess the efficacy of the role
manipulation, two 7-point scale items were administered before
participants exchanged feedback with their partners. The first item
indicated whether participants felt that they were offended by their
partner, and the second item indicated whether they felt that they
offended their partner. To assess the efficacy of the type of
message manipulation, participants were asked to indicate on two

An analysis of the feedback sent by participants to their fictitious
partners revealed a main effect for role on both subscales; that is, perpetrators’ feedback to their partners was more positive on both the Competence subscale, F(1, 178) ⫽ 14.92, p ⬍ . 001, and the Interpersonal Skills
subscale, F(1, 178) ⫽ 46.68, p ⬍ .001, compared with victims’ feedback.
The main effects for condition, as well as the Condition ⫻ Role interactions, were not significant for either subscale.

The measures of emotional needs that were examined in Study 1 were

Willingness to reconcile. Ten 7-point scales measured participants’ willingness to reconcile with their partners. Four items
measured participants’ willingness to continue cooperating with
their partner (e.g., I prefer to continue working with my partner to
I prefer to continue working with another partner); two items
measured participants’ perceptions of their future relationship with
their partner (e.g., I believe that working together on the next task
will be enjoyable to I don’t believe that working together on the
next task will be enjoyable); and four items measured participants’
general affective response (e.g., The feedback that I received from
my partner gave me a better feeling to The feedback that I received
from my partner did not give me a better feeling). Ratings for the
10 items were averaged to obtain a single measure of willingness
to reconcile (Cronbach’s ␣ ⫽ .81). Means and standard deviations
of the dependent variables are presented in Table 3.

Mediation Analyses
The empowerment–sense of power–willingness to reconcile
path. Following Kenny, Kashy, and Bolger (1998), to examine
whether the effect of the empowerment manipulation on victims’
willingness to reconcile was mediated by their perceived sense of
power, we first established that relationships existed between (a)
empowerment and willingness to reconcile (␤ ⫽ .31, p ⬍ .01); (b)
empowerment and sense of power (␤ ⫽ .27, p ⬍ .05); and (c)
sense of power and willingness to reconcile, when controlling for
empowerment (␤ ⫽ .40, p ⬍ .001). After we regressed willingness
to reconcile simultaneously on empowerment and sense of power,
the relation between empowerment and willingness to reconcile
was no longer significant (␤ ⫽ .19, p ⬎ .05). A Sobel test of
mediation (Sobel, 1982) confirmed that the indirect effect of
empowerment on willingness to reconcile significantly differed
from zero (z ⫽ 2.07, p ⬍ .05). This result indicated that among
victims, sense of power mediated the relationship between receiving a message of empowerment and willingness to reconcile, as
predicted by our theoretical model.
For perpetrators, by contrast, there was no significant relationship between receiving a message of empowerment and willingness to reconcile (␤ ⫽ .04, ns) or between sense of power and
willingness to reconcile (␤ ⫽ .09, ns).
The acceptance–public moral image–willingness to reconcile
path. To examine whether the effect of the acceptance manipulation on perpetrators’ willingness to reconcile was mediated by
their perceived public moral image, we first established that relationships existed between (a) acceptance and willingness to reconcile (␤ ⫽ .41, p ⬍ .001); (b) acceptance and public moral image
(␤ ⫽ .44, p ⬍ .001); and (c) public moral image and willingness
to reconcile, when controlling for acceptance (␤ ⫽ .32, p ⬍ .001).
After we regressed willingness to reconcile simultaneously on
acceptance and public moral image, the relationship between acceptance and willingness to reconcile decreased (␤ ⫽ .27, p ⬎
.005). A Sobel test of mediation confirmed that the indirect effect
of acceptance on willingness to reconcile significantly differed
from zero (z ⫽ 2.77, p ⬍ .01). This result indicates that among

perpetrators, public moral image partially mediated the relationship between receiving a message of acceptance and willingness to
reconcile, as predicted by our theoretical model. For victims, by
contrast, there was no significant relation between receiving a
message of acceptance and willingness to reconcile (␤ ⫽ ⫺.03, ns)
or between their public moral image and willingness to reconcile
(␤ ⫽ ⫺.09, ns).

Discussion
The results of Study 2 support our theoretical model. Receiving
a message of empowerment from an opponent positively affected
participants’ sense of power, but this change was associated with
increased willingness to reconcile only among victims; perpetrators’ willingness to reconcile was not affected by the change in
their sense of power. By contrast, receiving a message of acceptance from an opponent positively affected perpetrators’ public
moral image, and this change was associated with an increase in
their willingness to reconcile. Receiving a message of acceptance
did not enhance victims’ public moral image. This result might
reflect a ceiling effect; that is, because victims’ public moral image
had not been impaired in the first place (as suggested by our model
and as indicated by the finding that victims’ average score on
public moral image was 5.94 on a 7-point scale), it could not be
raised much further. Furthermore, as our claim is that the resources
that are damaged for victims and perpetrators are their sense of
power and public moral image, respectively, it makes sense that
the extent of change in these resources following messages of
empowerment or acceptance would be different due to the differences in their perspectives. To replicate the findings of Study 2 and
to extend their generalizability, we assessed the next two experiments and the same hypotheses by using vignettes that described
real-life situations.

Study 3
Study 3 tested the same hypotheses tested in Study 2 in the
context of a real-life situation. To accomplish this task, we used
two versions of the same vignette. Both depicted exactly the same
situation but from opposite perspectives: In the perpetrator condition, the protagonist was the offender and the antagonist was the
offended party, whereas in the victim condition, the roles were
reversed. In the story, the antagonist approached the protagonist
after the offense occurred and conveyed a message of empowerment, acceptance, empowerment and acceptance, or none of these.
It should be noted that it was highly important for the different
messages to be meaningful and relevant for both victims and
perpetrators. It is likely that a uniform message such as I understand your perspective or I acknowledge violating your rights
without any further reference to the specific context of the incident
would be perceived as too general and therefore artificial and even
condescending. We therefore decided to phrase different messages
for victims and perpetrators that would refer to the specific context
and details of the victimization episode and thus be perceived as
natural and meaningful for both victims and perpetrators. Despite
the different phrasing of the messages, they nevertheless manipulated the same variables (i.e., acceptance and empowerment);
furthermore, the measurement of the dependent variables was
identical for victims and perpetrators. We therefore conducted the

SHNABEL AND NADLER

124

analyses for victims and perpetrators together; the advantage of
conducting such an analysis (in contrast to conducting separate
analysis for each role) is that it makes it possible to detect a Role ⫻
Message interaction.
The experimental design was thus a 2 ⫻ 2 ⫻ 2 between-subjects
design: Role (victim vs. perpetrator) ⫻ Empowerment (included
vs. not included) ⫻ Acceptance (included vs. not included). Because the same theoretical constructs were manipulated differently,
this study could have been presented as two 2 (acceptance vs.
empowerment) ⫻ 2 (included vs. not included) experiments (i.e.,
for perpetrators and victims separately). The cost of such a strategy
would have been an inability to assess the statistical significance of
the Role ⫻ Message interaction, which is the central theoretical
prediction of this study. We therefore opted for the above 2 ⫻ 2 ⫻
2 factorial design. The dependent variables (sense of power, public
moral image, and willingness to reconcile) were identical to those
measured in Study 2.
On the basis of our theoretical model, we hypothesized that
although a message of empowerment would increase sense of
power for all participants, it would be associated with greater
willingness to reconcile only among victims. In contrast, a message of social acceptance would enhance the public moral image of
all participants but would facilitate reconciliation only among
perpetrators.

Method
Participants
Participants (N ⫽ 155) were 112 female and 43 male university
undergraduates (age: M ⫽ 22.5 years), who participated in the
experiment as a course requirement. Participants were randomly
assigned to one of the eight experimental conditions. Men and
women were represented in equal proportion in the eight experimental cells.

Materials and Procedure
Participants were told that they were taking part in a study on
interpersonal relationships. They were asked to read a short vignette about a student working as a waitron.5 In the story, the
waitron asks her superior for permission not to work a shift on
New Year’s Eve due to a very important exam she must take the
next day. The superior rejects the request because every employee
is needed on that particular evening. The protagonist in the story
was either the waitron (in the victim condition) or the superior (in
the perpetrator condition). The gender of both characters was
matched to that of the participant. At the end of the New Year’s
shift, the antagonist in the story (either the waitron or the superior)
approaches the protagonist and conveys a message containing
empowerment, acceptance, both, or neither (control).
In the victim condition, a message of social acceptance included
expressions by the superior of empathy for the victim following
the refusal of his or her request. A message of empowerment
included the superior’s accepting responsibility for having caused
an injustice to the waitron. In the perpetrator condition, a message
of social acceptance included the waitron’s expressions of understanding the fact that the superior had no option but to reject the
request and empathy for the uneasiness that this must have caused.

A message of empowerment included an acknowledgement by the
waitron of the perpetrator’s legitimate right to act as he or she did.6
After reading the vignette, participants received a questionnaire
that included the manipulation checks and the dependent variables
(sense of power, public moral image, and willingness to reconcile).
Upon completion, participants were thanked and debriefed.

Measures
Manipulation checks. Two 7-point scales were used to assess
the efficacy of the role manipulation. The first item asked participants to indicate the degree to which they felt offended by the
antagonist (victimization), and the second item asked participants
to indicate whether they felt that they had offended the antagonist
(perpetration). These checks were conducted before the type of
message manipulation was carried out.
Two 7-point scales were used to assess the efficacy of the type
of message manipulation. Participants were asked to indicate the
extent to which the message they had received expressed (a) social
acceptance (the extent to which the protagonist expressed empathy
toward the antagonist) and (b) empowerment (the extent to which
the antagonist accepted responsibility for misbehaving or recognized the protagonist’s right to behave as he or she did).
Sense of power, public moral image, and willingness to reconcile. These measures were identical to those used in Study 2,
except for minor adjustments in wording to suit the different
context of the vignette. For the 6 sense of power items, Cronbach’s
␣ ⫽ .86; for the 3 public moral image items, Cronbach’s ␣ ⫽ .81;
and for the 10 willingness to reconcile items, Cronbach’s ␣ ⫽ .88.
Means and standard deviations of the dependent variables are
presented in Table 4.

perpetration, a significant main effect of role, F(1, 151) ⫽ 9.12,
p ⬍ .005, ␩2 ⫽ .06, indicated that participants assigned to the
perpetrator condition felt that they had offended the antagonist
more than did participants assigned to the victim condition; means
were 3.91 and 3.09, respectively.
Type of message. A two-way ANOVA revealed a significant
main effect for acceptance, F(1, 151) ⫽ 141.31, p ⬍ .001, ␩2 ⫽

Waitron is a non-gender-specific term for waiter or waitress.
Our manipulation was based on the works of French and Raven (1959),
who viewed legitimate power as one of the resources of social power, and
Turner (2005), who suggested that “authority is the power to control
ingroup members because they are persuaded that it is right for a certain
person to control them in certain matters” (p. 11). It is implied from these
definitions that undermining the perpetrator’s right to force the victim to
work would weaken him, whereas an acceptance of his right to do so would
empower him.

also significant, F(1, 151) ⫽ 10.75, p ⬍ .001, ␩2 ⫽ .07, indicating
that perpetrators tended to perceive their partner’s message as
expressing more empowerment than did victims. The meanings of
the main effects were qualified by a Role ⫻ Empowerment interaction that approached significance, F(1, 151) ⫽ 3.04, p ⬍ .08,
␩2 ⫽ .02, which indicated that although the empowerment manipulation affected perceived empowerment of both victims and perpetrators, it affected victims more than it affected perpetrators (for
victims, means were 2.61 in the no-empowerment condition and
5.08 in the empowerment condition, whereas for perpetrators
means were 3.98 and 5.50, respectively).

To compare the magnitude of the effects, we regressed the acceptance

Then we compared the two regression coefficients by computing the

Mediation Analyses
The empowerment–sense of power–willingness to reconcile
path. To examine whether the effect of the empowerment manipulation on victims’ willingness to reconcile was mediated by
their perceived sense of power, we first established that relationships existed between (a) empowerment and willingness to reconcile (␤ ⫽ .45, p ⬍ .001); (b) empowerment and sense of power
(␤ ⫽ .46, p ⬍ .001); and (c) sense of power and willingness to
reconcile, when controlling for empowerment (␤ ⫽ .71, p ⬍ .001).
After we regressed willingness to reconcile simultaneously on
empowerment and sense of power, the relation between empowerment and willingness to reconcile was no longer significant (␤ ⫽
.12, p ⬎ .05). A Sobel test of mediation confirmed that the indirect
effect of empowerment on willingness to reconcile significantly
differed from zero (z ⫽ 6.47, p ⬍ .05). This indicated that among
victims, sense of power mediated the relationship between receiving a message of empowerment and willingness to reconcile, as
predicted by our theoretical model. For perpetrators, by contrast,
there was no significant relation between receiving a message of
empowerment and willingness to reconcile (␤ ⫽ .17, ns) or their
sense of power and willingness to reconcile (␤ ⫽ .10, ns).
The acceptance–public moral image–willingness to reconcile
path. To examine whether the effect of the acceptance manipulation on perpetrators’ willingness to reconcile was mediated by
their perceived public moral image, we first established that relationships existed between (a) acceptance and willingness to reconcile (␤ ⫽ .69, p ⬍ .001); (b) acceptance and public moral image
(␤ ⫽ .78, p ⬍ .001); and (c) public moral image and willingness
to reconcile, when controlling for acceptance (␤ ⫽ .59, p ⬍ .001).
After we regressed willingness to reconcile simultaneously on
acceptance and public moral image, the relationship between acceptance and willingness to reconcile decreased (␤ ⫽ .23, p ⫽
.05). A Sobel test of mediation confirmed that the indirect effect of
acceptance on willingness to reconcile significantly differed from
zero (z ⫽ 4.67, p ⬍ .001). This result indicates that among
perpetrators, public moral image partially mediated the relationship between receiving a message of acceptance and willingness to
reconcile, as predicted by our theoretical model.
For victims, by contrast, the relationship between receiving a
message of acceptance and willingness to reconcile approached
significance (␤ ⫽ .22, p ⬎ .06) as did the relationship between
public moral image and willingness to reconcile (␤ ⫽ .24, p ⬎
.07). Because the relationship between receiving a message of

acceptance and victims’ public moral image was significant (␤ ⫽
.51, p ⬍ .001), we decided to test the indirect effect. A Sobel test
proved the indirect effect to only approach significance (z ⫽ 1.71,
p ⬎ .08). This result suggests that although the acceptance–public
moral image–willingness to reconcile path did affect victims to
some extent, it affected victims much less than it affected perpetrators.

Discussion
In general, the results of Study 3 support our hypotheses. Receiving a message of acceptance increased participants’ public
moral image, but the increase in public moral image was related to
an increase in willingness to reconcile only among perpetrators;
victims’ public moral image was not related to willingness to
reconcile. By contrast, receiving a message of empowerment increased participants’ sense of power, but the increase in sense of
power was related to willingness to reconcile only among victims;
perpetrators’ sense of power did not affect their willingness to
reconcile. These findings support the main assertion of our model
that willingness to reconcile is mediated by satisfaction of victims’
and perpetrators’ different needs.
In addition to these findings, which lend direct support to our
model, we also found that the Role ⫻ Empowerment interaction
had a significant effect on both the empowerment manipulation
check and the sense of power measurement. These findings indicate that victims were more affected by a message of empowerment than were perpetrators. This might reflect victims’ stronger
motivation to restore their sense of power: Because victims’ sense
of power is impaired in the victimization episode, they might be
more sensitive to messages that remedy this impairment and therefore might be more affected by empowerment messages than
might perpetrators, whose sense of power has not been similarly
affected.
Similarly, the Role ⫻ Acceptance interaction had a significant
effect on both the acceptance manipulation check and the public
moral image measurement. These results indicate that perpetrators
were more affected by a message of acceptance than were victims.
This might reflect perpetrators’ stronger motivation to restore their
public moral image; that is, because perpetrators’ public moral
image is harmed in the victimization episode, they might be more
sensitive to messages that remedy this harm and therefore might be
more affected by such messages than might victims, whose public
moral image has not been similarly affected. These results are
consistent with our theoretical model.
Another intriguing finding is that although the manipulations of
acceptance and empowerment were perceived as intended, their
effects were not orthogonal. Participants perceived messages of
acceptance as expressing some amount of empowerment and messages of empowerment as expressing some amount of acceptance.
This nonorthogonality was also found in a study that assessed the
effects of receiving messages of empathy and responsibility (i.e.,
acceptance and empowerment in terms of the present study) on
participants’ willingness to reconcile in the context of intergroup
conflict (Nadler & Liviatan, 2006). Consistent with Nadler and
Liviatan’s (2006) suggestion, such nonorthogonality may be unavoidable in the context of a conflict when the opponent makes an
unexpected positive gesture. However, this nonorthogonality represents an unavoidable partial overlap rather than equivalence in

NEEDS-BASED MODEL OF RECONCILIATION

the effects of these two independent variables. The fact that the
magnitude of the effect of each independent variable on its corresponding manipulation check (i.e., acceptance on perceived acceptance and empowerment on perceived empowerment) was higher
than its effect on the noncorresponding measure (i.e., empowerment on perceived acceptance and acceptance on perceived empowerment) supports this view. Also, the effects of these two
variables on the main dependent measures were consistent with
our predictions. This suggests that our manipulations are better
seen as emphasizing empowerment or acceptance rather than as
excluding one or the other.

Study 4
Study 4 tested the complete needs-based model of reconciliation, from the differential impairment of the psychological resources of victims and perpetrators through the fulfillment of
victims’ and perpetrators’ emotional needs, resulting in the increased willingness of the two sides to reconcile. Unlike the
previous experiments, which assessed participants’ perceptions
following a victimization episode (Study 1) or their perceptions
following the receipt of a message from their adversary (Studies 2
and 3), Study 4 assessed participants’ perceptions and willingness
to reconcile before and after receiving a message from their rival.
Thus, it examined the full range of the model’s hypotheses. The
major prediction of this study was that willingness to reconcile
should be characterized by a three-way Role ⫻ Message ⫻ Time
of Measurement interaction.

Method
Participants were asked to read a vignette and to imagine themselves as the protagonist who was either a victim or a perpetrator.
The experimental design followed a split plot factorial design: a 2
(role: victim vs. perpetrator) ⫻ 2 (message: empowerment vs.
acceptance) between-subjects design, combined with a withinsubject design (time: before vs. after receiving the message from
the antagonist).
In addition, in order to replicate the findings of Study 1, we
measured participants’ needs for power and social acceptance
before receiving the message from their partner. We predicted that,
as in Study 1, before receiving the message, victims would perceive themselves as weaker than perpetrators and would therefore
express a higher need for power, whereas perpetrators would
perceive themselves as having a worse public moral image compared with that of victims and would therefore express a higher
need for social acceptance.
On the basis of our theoretical model, we also hypothesized that
participants who received a message of acceptance from their
partner would exhibit higher ratings for public moral image than
would those who received a message of empowerment. In contrast,
a message of empowerment should enhance participants’ sense of
power more than should a message of acceptance. Further, we
predicted that the increase in participants’ public moral image
would be related to an increased willingness to reconcile only for
perpetrators, whereas an increase in participants’ sense of power
would be related to an increased willingness to reconcile only for
victims. Thus, we predicted a three-way Time ⫻ Message ⫻ Role
interaction on the measure of willingness to reconcile.

Participants
Participants (N ⫽ 94) were 75 female and 19 male university
undergraduates (age: M ⫽ 23.5 years), who were randomly assigned to the four experimental cells. Men and women were
represented in equal proportion in the four experimental cells. The
questionnaire was distributed to participants via e-mail, and over
90% returned the completed questionnaires. Participants received
payment or course credit for their participation.

Materials and Procedure
Participants were told that they were taking part in a study on
interpersonal relationships. They were asked to read a short vignette about an employee in an advertising company who was
absent from work for 2 weeks due to maternity leave (for women)
or military reserve duty (for men)—the most common reasons for
extended work absences in Israeli society. The gender of both the
protagonist and the antagonist were matched to that of the participant.
It was further indicated that upon returning to the office, the
employee learned that a colleague who had temporarily filled her
position was ultimately promoted to her job, whereas she herself
was demoted. The demoted employee blamed her colleague for
this demotion. In the victim condition, participants were asked to
imagine themselves as the employee who was demoted from her
position; in the perpetrator condition, participants were asked to
imagine themselves as the colleague who was promoted. Following these instructions, participants received a questionnaire that
included the before measures: (a) manipulation checks (measuring
the extent to which participants perceived themselves as victims or
perpetrators), (b) sense of power, (c) public moral image, (d)
willingness to reconcile, and (e) psychological needs for power
and social acceptance.
After they completed these measures, participants received the
second part of the vignette, which included the manipulation of the
content of the antagonist’s message (i.e., a message of acceptance
or empowerment). The story continued as follows: After a week, in
a staff feedback meeting, the antagonist either praised the protagonist’s interpersonal skills but made no mention of her professional skills (acceptance condition) or praised the protagonist’s
professional skills but said nothing about her interpersonal skills
(empowerment condition).
Subsequently, participants were asked to respond to a second
questionnaire that included the after measures: (a) manipulation
checks (the extent to which the message was perceived as expressing empowerment or acceptance), (b) sense of power, (c) public
moral image, and (d) willingness to reconcile. Upon completion,
participants were thanked and debriefed.

Measures
The following measures were taken in the first (before) questionnaire.
Manipulation checks. Participants were asked to indicate on a
7-point scale the degree to which they (a) were offended by their
partner, (b) offended their partner, and (c) perceived that their
partner was angry with them. Ratings for the first item assessed
perceived victimhood. Ratings for the second and third items

SHNABEL AND NADLER

assessed perceived perpetration. The latter two items were highly
correlated (r ⫽ .80) and were averaged to obtain a single measure
of perpetration.
Sense of power, public moral image, and willingness to reconcile. The items used in these measurements were almost identical
to those used in Studies 2 and 3, with the exception of minor
changes in phrasing to suit the vignette. Six 7-point scale items
measured participants’ sense of power (Cronbach’s ␣ ⫽ .90), three
7-point scale items measured participants’ public moral image
(Cronbach’s ␣ ⫽ .93), and ten 7-point scale items measured
willingness to reconcile (Cronbach’s ␣ ⫽ .74).
Psychological needs. The items used in these measurements
were almost identical to those used in Study 1, except for minor
changes in phrasing to suit the context of the vignette. Four 7-point
scale items measured participants’ need for power (Cronbach’s
␣ ⫽ .94); and five 7-point scale items measured participants’ need
for social acceptance (Cronbach’s ␣ ⫽ .86). The following measures were taken in the second (after) questionnaire.
Manipulation checks. Participants were asked to indicate on a
7-point scale the degree to which they believed that (a) the antagonist appreciated their professional skills and (b) the antagonist
appreciated their interpersonal skills.
Dependent variables. Sense of power, public moral image,
and willingness to reconcile were measured with the same items as
those in the before measurement. Cronbach’s alpha reliabilities
were .92, .96, and .91, respectively. Means and standard deviations
of the dependent variables are presented in Table 5.

Results
Manipulation Checks
Manipulation checks in the first and second questionnaires were
tested by a series of t tests. For victimhood, a significant difference

between the cells, t(69) ⫽ 6.02, p ⬍ .001, indicated that participants assigned to the victim role perceived themselves as victims
more than did participants assigned to the perpetrator role; means
were 6.04 and 4.20, respectively. For perpetration, a significant
difference between the cells, t(71) ⫽ ⫺15.66, p ⬍ .001, indicated
that participants assigned to the perpetrator role perceived themselves as perpetrators more than did participants assigned to the
victim role; means were 5.22 and 1.64, respectively.
A significant main effect for acceptance, t(84) ⫽ ⫺7.06, p ⬍
.001, indicated that participants assigned to the acceptance condition believed that the antagonist appreciated their interpersonal
skills more than did participants assigned to the empowerment
condition; means were 6.00 and 4.15, respectively. Likewise, a
significant main effect for empowerment, t(72) ⫽ 7.31, p ⬍ .001,
indicated that participants assigned to the empowerment condition
believed that the antagonist appreciated their professional skills
more than did participants assigned to the acceptance condition;
means were 6.08 and 4.05, respectively.

Possible explanations for this finding are suggested in the Discussion section of this study.
For willingness to reconcile, the significant main effects for

To interpret the three-way interaction, we conducted a Message ⫻

Victims tended to have a higher willingness to reconcile in the

condition, t(39) ⫽ ⫺2.05, p ⬍ .05. Thus, as predicted, a message
of acceptance was more effective in promoting reconciliation
among perpetrators, whereas a message of empowerment was
more effective in promoting reconciliation among victims.

Discussion
The results of Study 4 support our theoretical model. First,
this study replicated the findings of Study 1 that being a
perpetrator threatens one’s public moral image, resulting in a
greater need for social acceptance, and that being a victim
threatens one’s sense of power, resulting in a greater need for
power. Second, the repeated measures analyses revealed that
the messages of acceptance and empowerment had the expected
effect on the restoration of participants’ psychological resources: The increase in participants’ sense of power was higher
following a message of empowerment than following a message
of acceptance; in contrast, the increase in participants’ public
moral image was higher following a message of acceptance than
following a message of empowerment. Third, as expected, the
increase in victims’ willingness to reconcile was higher in the
empowerment condition than in the acceptance condition,
whereas the reverse pattern was true for perpetrators, whose
willingness to reconcile increased in the acceptance condition
more than it did in the empowerment condition. Thus, the
restoration of the differentially impaired psychological resources of victims and perpetrators promoted their willingness
to reconcile.
The finding that across conditions (i.e., after receiving any
positive message from their partner, either acceptance or empowerment) victims’ sense of power increased, whereas that of
perpetrators’ decreased, which may imply a regression to the
mean effect on the second measurement. Alternatively, for
victims, this increase in sense of power may indicate that their
greater need for power led them to interpret any positive message from their partner as affirming their power. The parallel
finding that the increase in public moral image across conditions was significantly higher for perpetrators than for victims
may be similarly explained as reflecting perpetrators’ greater
need for signs of acceptance, which may have led them to
interpret any positive gesture from their partner as implying
acceptance. Finally, the perpetrators’, but not the victims’,
greater increase in willingness to reconcile across conditions,
which cannot by explained as a regression to mean effect (as
perpetrators’ initial level of willingness to reconcile was higher
than that of victims), may be interpreted as reflecting their
relatively greater need to restore social harmony with the victim, which finds expression in willingness to reconciliation in
response to any positive indication from the other side.

General Discussion
The above four experiments support the hypotheses of the
needs-based model of reconciliation. Taken together, these studies
indicate that a victimizing episode makes victims feel less powerful and perpetrators feel more morally inadequate. Thus, the main
psychological resource that is damaged for victims is their sense of
power, whereas the main psychological resource that is damaged

130

SHNABEL AND NADLER

for perpetrators is their sense of belongingness and social acceptance. Consequently, a social exchange interaction that restores the
respective psychological resources of the adversaries facilitates
their willingness to reconcile. These findings support the main
tenet of our model, which states that reconciliation between adversaries depends on satisfying relevant emotional needs and restoring their damaged psychological resources.
The empirical support for our hypotheses is underscored by the
methodological differences that existed between the five studies:
Studies 1 and 2 tested the hypotheses in the context of a laboratory
experiment in which the social role (victim or perpetrator) was determined ad hoc, whereas Studies 3 and 4 were role-playing experiments
in which participants imagined how they would feel and act in a
vignette they had read; yet another study (mentioned in the Discussion
section of Study 1) used the context of real-life situations. The studies
also differed on the following dimensions: (a) the characteristics of
the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator, such as
whether these were relationships between strangers who had not met
before (Studies 1 and 2) or imagined relationships in the workplace
that were either hierarchical (Study 3) or equal (Study 4); and (b) the
type of harm caused, such as limiting the victim’s capacity to influence the situation (Study 3), harming the victims’ self-esteem (Studies
1 and 2), or a combination of the two (Study 4).
The primary contribution of the model is that it presents a
motivational perspective on socio-emotional reconciliation processes. Although existing models of conflict resolution address the
motivations of adversaries in conflict, these motivations are usually conceptualized in general and unspecific terms, such as the
motivation for maximization of outcomes (Rusbult & Van Lange,
1996). In contrast, the present model outlines specific motivations
and pinpoints how they are related to the impairment of psychological resources among parties in conflict. Furthermore, the
model differentiates between the emotional motivations of victims
and perpetrators, as opposed to prior studies that have focused on
only one side of the conflict— usually the victim. In place of this
one-sided focus, the current perspective focuses on the interaction
between victims and perpetrators and how this may facilitate (or
inhibit) reconciliation between them. Naturally, such a perspective
is theoretically and empirically more complex. The main assertion
of the model—that reconciliation requires a successful emotional
“barter” between victims and perpetrators integrates intrapersonal
processes with interpersonal processes in a manner that is characteristically absent from social psychology (Semin, 1997).
The needs-based model of reconciliation offers a general theoretical framework for understanding the findings of other studies in
the field. Findings that the effectiveness of an apology increases
when accompanied by an admission of guilt by the perpetrator
(Darby & Schlenker, 1982) might be interpreted as reflecting the
fact that an admission of guilt satisfies victims’ need for empowerment. Fatal quarrels instigated “over nothing,” which are the
focus of Cohen, Nisbett, Bowdle, and Schwarz’s (1996) study on
the Southern culture of honor, are not conflicts over the division of
contested resources. In terms of our model, these are conflicts over
the emotional resources of acceptance and empowerment. Similarly, the social needs for vengeance (discussed by Frijda, 1994)
and for forgiveness (Enright et al., 1998) may be conceptualized as
reflecting victims’ need to restore their sense of power and perpetrators’ need to restore their public moral image and sense of
belonging to the community.

The Type of Victimization Episodes Used in the Present
Research and the Question of Culpability
Because our model addresses the interaction between parties in
conflict, it was important to be able to randomly assign participants
to the role of perpetrator and victim in both laboratory experiments
and the role-playing vignettes. Random assignment to the role of
victim is relatively easy because of the passive nature of this social
role. The induction of the perception that one is a perpetrator is
more difficult. It requires that participants view themselves as
having volitionally hurt another person who had done them no
harm. Situations in which the victimization is done unintentionally
(e.g., the perpetrator looked after the victim’s child and did not pay
attention to the child’s drinking of a poisonous substance—a
vignette used by Schönbach, 1990) are inadequate for this purpose
as they do not follow the conditions required for the attribution of
blame, that is, that the perpetrator will be able to foresee the
consequences of his conduct, have control over his behavior, and
behave intentionally in a given way (Shaver, 1985). Situations in
which a person hurts another person with no immediately available
justification (e.g., a sadistic act) are also problematic as it would
have been impossible to randomly place participants in an experimental setting in which they hurt another person for no apparent
reason or justification; similarly, in the case of role-playing studies, it does not make sense that such situations would produce an
appropriate level of identification. Thus, the induction of perpetration that holds moral responsibility is possible only if viewed by
the average person as related to contextual demands such as job
requirements or conflicting interests (such as when favoring selfinterest involves hurting the partner and vice versa).
Although at first glance this characteristic of the present research may seem to limit the generalizability of the findings and
the model, closer scrutiny reveals that this is not the case. First,
most daily real-life interactions between victims and perpetrators
have characteristics that are similar to the ones in our research. In
fact, when we asked people to report on real-life episodes in which
they had caused harm to another person (i.e., see description of the
study in the Discussion section of Study 1) they reported episodes
in which there had been some justification to hurt the other person,
such as preferring one’s own interests over the other’s interests,
retaliation for previous harm done to them, doing an honest job of
criticizing the other, unwillingness to have the extent of proximity
desired by the victims (such as in breaking up with a romantic
partner), et cetera. Although one could argue that such accounts
represent selective reporting, research indicates that perpetrators
tend to deny their culpability, even when their behavior is judged
as blameworthy by others (Baumeister, 1996; Mikula, 2002). The
gap between victims and perpetrators in their perceptions of the
latter’s culpability is consistent with current literature on justice,
which suggests that people’s affective reactions (e.g., anger or
satisfaction) to the outcome of a certain situation influences
their judgments of its fairness rather than the other way around
(in other words, justice judgments are emotionally, rather than
cognitively, based; Mullen & Skitka, 2006). It makes sense that
because victims and perpetrators experience different emotions
following a victimization episode, their perceptions of it as unjust,
and consequently, their perceptions of the perpetrator’s blameworthiness/culpability, will be different in a predictable/consistent

NEEDS-BASED MODEL OF RECONCILIATION

manner. For this reason, it is claimed that “evil is in the eyes of the
beholder” (Baumeister, 1996, p. 1).
Second, this characteristic of our research does not affect the
major claim of our model. It should be recalled that the model
suggests that regardless of feelings of objective or subjective
justifications and the associated feelings of guilt that one has for
having harmed another person, perpetrators have a need to ameliorate the perception that others view their behavior as wrong and
relatively immoral. This perception represents a threat to inclusion
in one’s moral community that a message of acceptance is argued
to ameliorate. Such perceptions of threat to inclusion in the moral
community were successfully induced in our experiments as is
evidenced by the decrease in public moral image suffered by
participants who had been randomly assigned to the role of perpetrators.

development of restorative practices, that is, practices that restore
relationships, connections among people, trust, and mutual understanding and thus make cooperative problem solving possible
(Wachtel & McCold, 2001). These practices involve nurturing the
expression of vulnerable emotions (Braithwaite, 2006), and our
model can cast light upon the nature of these emotions as well as
on the psychological needs that lie beneath them.
In conclusion, our focus on the emotional motivations underlying the reconciliation process comes on the heels of a relatively
long period during which these motivations were neglected in
favor of more instrumental concerns. However, understanding the
factors that help to repair relationships between victims and perpetrators has practical meaning for the fields of conflict resolution
and reconciliation.

Limitations and Future Research Directions
The present model suggests a number of issues that may be
researched in the future. The first of these is that the dependent
variable measured in Studies 2, 3, and 4 was a self-rated willingness to reconcile. Because the success of the reconciliation process
is highly dependent upon the adversaries’ attitudes (e.g., their
willingness to be involved in such a process, their perceptions of
future relations) we believe this measure to be adequate for testing
our model’s hypotheses. However, because we aim to apply our
model to real-life conflicts, it remains for future research to determine the extent to which self-rated willingness to reconcile predicts actual reconciliatory behavior.
Second, our model and research focuses on situations in which
there is a relative consensus regarding who the victim is. Yet, in
many real-life situations in which such consensus does not exist,
both parties may perceive themselves as victims, and there may
even exist a degree of competition over who is the “real” victim
(Nadler, 2002). Although we assume that our model also applies to
such complex situations, it remains for future research to address
this issue empirically.
Third, applying the needs-based model of reconciliation to intergroup contexts might provide a broad framework to test variables, such as strength of ingroup identification, collective guilt
(Doosje, Branscombe, Spears, & Manstead, 1998), and level of
social categorization (Wohl & Branscombe, 2005), which have
been found to influence the willingness of group members to
reconcile. Nadler and Liviatan (2006) provided partial support for
the model’s applicability to the intergroup level in a study that
tested the willingness of Jewish Israelis to reconcile with Palestinians. The researchers found that in predicting willingness to
reconcile, Jewish Israeli subjects (who belong to the more powerful party in the conflict and are therefore likely to be viewed as the
guilty oppressors) were more responsive to Palestinians’ expressions of empathy with Israelis (which can be viewed as a manifestation of social acceptance) than to Palestinians’ acceptance of
responsibility for hurting them (which can be viewed as a manifestation of empowerment). However, further research is required
in order to provide more comprehensive support for the model’s
applicability at the intergroup level.
Finally, on the practical level, the needs-based model of reconciliation can contribute to the advancement of emotionally intelligent justice (a term suggested by Sherman, 2003) through the
