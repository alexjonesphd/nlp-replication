How do youths’ personality reports differ from those of adults? To identify the year-by-year timing of
developmental trends from late childhood (age 10) to early adulthood (age 20), the authors examined Big
Five self-report data from a large and diverse Internet sample. At younger ages within this range, there
were large individual differences in acquiescent responding, and acquiescence variability had pronounced
effects on psychometric characteristics. Beyond the effects of acquiescence, self-reports generally
became more coherent within domains, and better differentiated across domains, at older ages. Importantly, however, different Big Five domains showed different developmental trends. Extraversion showed
especially pronounced age gains in coherence but no gains in differentiation. In contrast, Agreeableness
and Conscientiousness showed large age gains in differentiation but only trivial gains in coherence.
Neuroticism and Openness showed moderate gains in both coherence and differentiation. Comparisons
of items that were relatively easy versus difficult to comprehend indicated that these patterns were not
simply due to verbal comprehension. These findings have important implications for the study of
personality characteristics and other psychological attributes in childhood and adolescence.

this article, we derive specific hypotheses about the characteristics
of youths’ personality self-reports. We then test these hypotheses
by using data from a large and diverse sample of children, adolescents, and young adults who provided self-reports for the Big
Five personality trait domains. The large sample size allowed
separate analyses—with high statistical precision—at each year of
age from 10 to 20.

The years spanning late childhood and adolescence constitute a
time of considerable biological, social, and psychological change.
These rapid developments raise questions about the capacity of
children and adolescents to report about their own personality
traits, that is, their characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings, and
behavior. At what age can youths provide meaningful personality
self-reports? In what ways do the reports of youths differ from
those of adults? Is it easier for young respondents to report about
some personality characteristics than about others? These basic
questions are crucial for theorists, researchers, and practitioners
interested in personality, emotional, and social development prior
to adulthood. Definitive answers, however, are not yet available. In

Important Developmental Changes in Late Childhood and
Adolescence
Over the course of late childhood and adolescence, youths
experience several developmental changes with implications for
the capacity to provide personality self-reports.

Late childhood (often defined approximately as ages 8 –11) and
adolescence (often defined approximately as ages 12–17) have
long been recognized as periods of change in fundamental reasoning abilities (Inhelder & Piaget, 1958). For example, compared
with younger children, adolescents have greater capacities to evaluate the logical consistency of statements (Osherson & Markman,
1975) as well as to think abstractly and consider the hypothetical,
rather than being tied to the concrete and immediate (Flavell,
Miller, & Miller, 1993). Increases in capacities for abstract reasoning are accompanied, not coincidentally, by capacities and
motivations to think about the self and consider questions of
identity: Who am I? Am I a worthwhile person? What makes me
different from others? Indeed, the search for a coherent self718

YOUTHS’ BIG FIVE SELF-REPORTS

concept is often considered the central psychological task of adolescence (Erikson, 1968).
As adolescents work on the task of identity development, their
self-concept changes; these changes have received considerable
and ongoing attention from developmental and educational psychologists. For example, one recent study found that correlations
among different self-aspects (e.g., skill and interest in sports vs.
quality of relationship with parents) decreased with age in a
sample of French students in Grades 2 through 6 (Marsh & Ayotte,
2003). More generally, compared with younger children, adolescents are more likely to think about and describe themselves with
abstract and psychological terms (e.g., “I am popular and athletic”
vs. “I have a friend named Betty and I like baseball”), to differentiate among multiple aspects of the self, to recognize consistencies and inconsistencies among these self-aspects, and to organize
them in a clear way (Byrne & Shavelson, 1996; Donahue, 1994;
Harter, 1999, 2006; Harter & Monsour, 1992; Marsh, 1989; Marsh
& Ayotte, 2003; Montemayor & Eisen, 1977). By contrast, in the
study of personality traits (which we review below), age trends in
coherence and differentiation have received much less attention.

Changes in Verbal Comprehension
Late childhood and adolescence are times of ongoing gains in
verbal capacities. The continued growth of vocabulary throughout
childhood and adolescence (Smith, 1941) includes the addition of
new personality-relevant words, as well as increasingly frequent
and complex use of such words (Donahue, 1994; Yuill, 1993).
There are also changes in key reading comprehension skills
(Siegler, 1998). Adolescents are better able to monitor their own
comprehension and take corrective action when a passage is not
fully understood (Garner, 1990). Such skills can help adolescents
make sense of many kinds of texts, including personality questionnaires.

Changes in Basic Personality Trait Structure
Over the course of childhood and adolescence, the basic organization of cognition, affect, and behavior itself may change.
Recent reviews of the available literature (Caspi & Shiner, 2006;
Shiner, 2006) have offered two conclusions. On the one hand,
some researchers have moved toward accepting the Big Five as a
representation of basic personality trait dimensions in childhood
and adolescence (e.g., Digman, 1994; Goldberg, 2001; Halverson
et al., 2003; Kohnstamm, Halverson, Mervielde, & Havill, 1998).
On the other hand, several findings are not easily reconciled with
the canonical Big Five structure (e.g., Hampson & Goldberg,
2006; John, Caspi, Robins, Moffitt, & Stouthamer-Loeber, 1994;
Lamb, Chuang, Wessels, Broberg, & Hwang, 2002; van Lieshout
& Haselager, 1994), and further research is needed before the issue
can be considered settled.
A pair of studies examined the factor structure of ratings of
children’s and adolescents’ personality traits by adult informants
with an instrument specifically designed for the description of
child personality, namely the California Child Q-set (Block &
Block, 1980). Their findings, emerging in samples from the United
States (John et al., 1994) and the Netherlands (van Lieshout &
Haselager, 1994), converge in suggesting age differences in trait
structure. In both studies, Extraversion did not cohere as it typi-

719

cally does in ratings of adults; instead, it was represented by two
distinct components.
A third study employing California Child Q-set parent reports
followed 102 Swedish children from early childhood into adolescence (Lamb et al., 2002). Although the sample size of this
longitudinal study was not large enough to provide robust factoranalytic results, the internal consistency of the Extraversion scale
developed by John et al. (1994) increased substantially from early
childhood to adolescence, as did its correlation with a California
Child Q-set scale assessing activity level. Consistent with all of
these results, Eaton (1994) argued that activity level is a distinct,
basic dimension of personality during infancy and childhood that
then retreats to lesser status as a facet of Extraversion by adulthood. Thus, the Extraversion domain may be fundamentally less
cohesive in childhood and early adolescence than in adulthood,
although the exact timing of this change is not yet well documented.

Testing Implications for Personality Self-Reports
The developmental changes reviewed above should affect how
well children and adolescents can report about their own personalities. Here we discuss the implications of these changes for
youths’ personality self-reports, review previous literature that has
examined such reports, identify open questions, and articulate
specific hypotheses tested in the present research.

General Changes in Within-Domain Coherence
Within-domain coherence, or internal consistency, is the extent
to which items intended to measure the same trait are highly
correlated with one another; stronger correlations among items
within a domain indicate greater coherence. In general, the withindomain coherence of personality self-reports should increase with
age, for at least two reasons. First, most older adolescents and
adults have available clear self-concepts that should provide useful
reference points for making coherent judgments about their personalities. Second, older adolescents are better at evaluating issues
of logical consistency, which should help them avoid contradictions in their personality reports (e.g., claiming that they are both
generally talkative and generally quiet) and thereby strengthen
relations among items within the same domain.
One previous study compared the coherence of self-reports on a
Big Five measure across adolescent age groups. In a sample of
Estonian secondary school students, the mean alpha reliability for
the five scales of the 60-item NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEOFFI; Costa & McCrae, 1992) was lower for 12-year-olds (M ⫽ .72)
than for 16- and 18-year-olds (M ⫽ .81); the mean alphas for these
older student samples were about as high as that observed in an
adult sample (M ⫽ .82; Allik, Laidra, Realo, & Pullman, 2004).
Another study found that NEO-FFI responses in a small sample of
young Mexican Americans and European Americans (N ⫽ 130,
age range ⫽ 10.00 to 12.66 years) yielded alpha coefficients
substantially lower (M ⫽ .55) than those typically observed in
adult samples (Markey, Markey, Tinsley, & Ericksen, 2002).
These findings suggest that important developmental changes in
within-domain coherence occur at some point prior to late adolescence. However, pinpointing the precise timing and extent of age
differences requires more detailed data than have been available

720

SOTO, JOHN, GOSLING, AND POTTER

previously. Here, we examine the within-domain coherence of
youths’ personality self-reports at each year of age from 10 to 20.
We hypothesize that, when averaged across the Big Five domains,
coherence is better at older ages, with rapid gains in late childhood
and early adolescence followed by smaller gains in late adolescence.

General Changes in Between-Domain Differentiation
Between-domain differentiation is the extent to which scales
that assess conceptually distinct traits have low correlations with
each other; lower between-domain correlations indicate better differentiation. In general, the differentiation of youths’ personality
self-reports should increase with age. As research on selfrepresentations and identity has shown (see above), adolescents
can more readily distinguish among different social roles than can
younger children. This increased differentiation of self-aspects
should be accompanied by a similar increase in the capacity to rate
distinct personality traits independently of each other.
In the Estonian sample of secondary school students mentioned
above, the mean intercorrelation among the five NEO-FFI scales
was .24 among 12-year-olds, compared with .12 among 18-yearolds (Allik et al., 2004). However, the extent and timing of age
differences in between-domain differentiation remain to be investigated more precisely. Here, we examine between-domain differentiation at each year of age from 10 to 20, and we test the
hypothesis that—averaged across the Big Five domains—
differentiation is substantially better at older ages, with particularly
large gains during late childhood and early adolescence.

Unique Developmental Trends in Coherence and
Differentiation for Specific Big Five Domains
While age gains in within-domain coherence and betweendomain differentiation should hold in the aggregate, there are also
reasons to expect a more complex pattern at the level of the
individual domains. That is, some of the Big Five should show
developmental trends in coherence and differentiation that are
quite different from the overall trends. One reason for this expectation concerns previous findings suggesting that the basic organization of personality traits changes with age. If the broad domain
of Extraversion is fundamentally less cohesive in childhood and
early adolescence than in adulthood, or even consists of distinct
components, then measures of Extraversion should show especially dramatic age gains in coherence.
A second reason concerns the focus of early socialization processes. Parents and teachers convey to young children that there
are appropriate (good) and inappropriate (bad) ways to behave. As
articulated by Digman (1997), in Big Five terms, being a good
child involves acting both agreeably (e.g., “don’t hit,” “share with
your brother/sister”) and conscientiously (e.g., “do as you’re told,”
“pick up after yourself”). By contrast, being a bad child involves
making trouble for parents and teachers, as captured by the externalizing construct in child psychopathology (Achenbach, 1966,
1978, 1979), which has been linked empirically to low levels of
both Agreeableness and Conscientiousness (John et al., 1994;
Robins, John, & Caspi, 1994). Given these elaborated notions of
what constitutes good and bad behavior, children should have
relatively coherent concepts of Agreeableness and Conscientious-

ness but may have trouble distinguishing between these two ways
of being good. Put another way, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness should show high within-domain coherence from a young age
but should lack clear differentiation until later on.
A third reason to expect domain differences in age trends
concerns item comprehension. Even for adults, questionnaire items
differ in how easy or difficult they are to comprehend, and less
comprehensible items tend to show less desirable psychometric
characteristics (e.g., Angleitner, John, & Löhr, 1986). Items written to assess some personality domains may be particularly difficult for young respondents. For example, the Openness scale of the
NEO-FFI includes several items that seem difficult for children to
comprehend and relate to their own lives, such as an item asking
them whether they are tolerant of other lifestyles and another
asking whether students should be allowed to listen to controversial speakers. Perhaps because of this, even in a sample of academically gifted early adolescents (M ⫽ 12.0 years) who completed the NEO-FFI, fully one-third of the 12 Openness items did
not load substantially on the principal component representing
Openness (Parker & Stumpf, 1998). Even for personality questionnaires that are generally easier to understand than is the NEO-FFI,
measures of Openness may show particularly large age gains in
coherence.
The issue of whether self-reports for different personality domains show different age trends in within-domain coherence and
between-domain differentiation remains to be examined systematically. Are young respondents better able to report about some
personality characteristics than about others? Here we test three
novel hypotheses: (a) that Extraversion will show particularly
large age gains in coherence; (b) that Agreeableness and Conscientiousness will show large gains in differentiation— especially in
differentiation from each other; and (c) that Openness will show
especially large gains in coherence.

Changes in Factor Structure
General age trends in coherence and differentiation, as well as
specific trends for specific personality domains, should combine to
influence the factor structure of multidimensional personality measures. Because all of these trends affect overall factor structure
simultaneously, it is difficult to anticipate how any specific trend
will be manifested in the overall structure. In general, however, the
intended factor structures of personality measures should be recovered less clearly in the responses of children and adolescents
than in those of adults.
Some previous studies of adolescents’ self-reports have recovered versions of the Big Five structure in samples as young as age
12 (Allik et al., 2004; McCrae et al., 2002; Parker & Stumpf,
1998). However, these studies all used a single instrument, the
NEO-FFI, and the adolescent structures were not identical or
nearly identical to this measure’s adult structure, even when target
rotation was used to maximize congruence (Allik et al., 2004). For
example, in a sample of academically gifted early adolescents, 9 of
the 60 NEO-FFI items (15%), did not have substantial loadings on
their intended primary component (Parker & Stumpf, 1998).
We do not yet know whether the findings of these studies using
the NEO-FFI can be generalized to other measures. Moreover, the
structure of responses from individuals younger than age 12 remains to be examined separately from older age groups, raising the

YOUTHS’ BIG FIVE SELF-REPORTS

question of whether the Big Five structure can be recovered at ages
younger than this. Here we examine data from a diverse sample
that was large enough to conduct factor analyses separately for
each specific year of age from 10 to 20. We use a Big Five measure
written approximately at the reading level of a fifth grader or
11-year-old (Benet-Martı́nez & John, 1998), namely the Big Five
Inventory (BFI; John, Donahue, & Kentle, 1991; John, Naumann,
& Soto, in press; John & Srivastava, 1999). We therefore hypothesize that the intended five-factor structure of the BFI is recognizable by age 11.

Changes in Variability of Acquiescent Responding
Acquiescent response style refers to the tendency of an individual to consistently agree (yea-saying) or consistently disagree
(nay-saying) with questionnaire items, regardless of their content
(Jackson & Messick, 1958). When individuals within a sample
differ substantially in their acquiescence tendencies (i.e., some
tend to agree more and others tend to agree less), this variation
introduces a positive covariance for every item pair, regardless of
item content and scoring direction, and thus tends to positively bias
interitem correlations. Correlations that would be positive in the
absence of acquiescence variation are made even more positive,
and correlations that would be negative are made less negative.
This positive biasing of interitem correlations has undesirable
effects on personality self-reports. At the item level, if acquiescence variation is not removed prior to factor analysis, individual
differences in acquiescent responding often result in the emergence of a factor representing the within-person mean item response (McCrae, Herbst, & Costa, 2001; Ten Berge, 1999). At the
scale level, if a scale does not have balanced keying (i.e., an equal
number of true-keyed and false-keyed items), its internal consistency will be artificially inflated by the positively biased interitem
correlations, but its validity will be decreased because measurement of the desired construct will be confounded with acquiescence.
Moreover, individual differences in acquiescent responding influence the mean scores on a scale with an unequal number of trueand false-keyed items. A respondent who tends to agree with
items, regardless of their content, will score too high on a scale
with more true-keyed items than false-keyed items and too low on
a scale with more false-keyed items. Because of this, acquiescence
variability will also bias the correlation between two scales that do
not have balanced item keying. This correlation will be positively
biased if both scales have mostly true-keyed or mostly false-keyed
items, or negatively biased if one scale is mostly true-keyed and
the other is mostly false-keyed.
Variability in acquiescent responding should be greater at
younger ages, for several reasons. As reviewed above, older adolescents have clearer self-concepts, as well as larger vocabularies
and better verbal comprehension skills, than do younger adolescents and children. Older adolescents are also likely to have more
experience with both informal questionnaires (e.g., personality and
attitude quizzes in teen magazines) and formal questionnaires (e.g.,
teaching evaluations), and thus a better understanding of implicit
norms about how to respond to questionnaire items (e.g., that
responses should be centered around the midpoint of a multiplestep rating scale). For all of these reasons, younger respondents
should be less certain about how to interpret and respond to any

721

particular questionnaire item, leaving greater room for the influence of systematic response styles (Goldberg, 1963), including
individual differences in acquiescence. Changes in critical reasoning capacities during early adolescence, and thus the presence of
substantial individual differences in these capacities, may also
contribute to especially great variability in acquiescent response
style during this period (cf. Knowles & Condon, 1999).
Despite these reasons to expect greater individual differences in
acquiescent responding at younger ages, the influence of acquiescence on youths’ personality self-reports remains to be examined.
Here, we test the novel hypotheses that (a) younger respondents
show greater individual differences in acquiescent responding; and
(b) individual differences in acquiescence have greater effects on
the coherence, differentiation, and overall structure of personality
self-reports at younger ages.1

The Role of Verbal Comprehension
Because understanding a personality questionnaire item is a necessary precondition to providing a valid response, age differences in
comprehension might explain why youths’ personality self-reports
differ from those of adults. One relevant finding is that Estonian
adolescents with higher nonverbal intelligence scores provided more
internally consistent responses to the NEO-FFI than did adolescents
with lower scores (Allik et al., 2004). Moreover, as noted above, in
adult samples questionnaire items that are difficult to comprehend
tend to show less desirable measurement characteristics than do easier
items (Angleitner et al., 1986). However, the link between verbal
comprehension and the coherence of youths’ personality self-reports
remains to be tested. Are age and domain differences in the coherence
of youths’ personality self-reports simply due to the ongoing development of verbal comprehension skills?
The approach taken here focuses on comparing BFI scales and
items that are particularly difficult for youths to comprehend with
those that are particularly easy to comprehend. If developmental
trends in the coherence of youths’ personality self-reports are due to
verbal comprehension, then particularly difficult scales and items
should show much less coherence at young ages than do easier scales
and items, and the relation between item difficulty and coherence
should be stronger in childhood than in adulthood. Moreover, difficult
scales and items should show especially large age gains in coherence,
whereas easy scales and items should show smaller age differences.2
1

We did not have clear expectations regarding whether younger respondents would show more or less yea-saying, on average, than would older
respondents. Exploratory analyses did not show an effect of age on the
mean level of acquiescence; analyzed with a 2 (gender) ⫻ 11 (age) analysis
of variance, the effect of age on mean acquiescence was not statistically
significant, F(10, 230025) ⫽ 3.59, ns. However, even if there had been
mean-level age differences in acquiescence, they would not have affected
the patterns of interitem and interscale correlations examined here. They
would have affected only cross-age comparisons of scale means.
2
It is less clear how item difficulty should relate to between-domain
differentiation. On the one hand, younger respondents may have less clear
understandings of the personality characteristics they are asked to rate,
hurting differentiation. On the other hand, they may respond to a difficult
item less reliably, thus “helping” differentiation (by reducing the correlation of that item with all other scales and items). Exploratory analyses
indicated that item-comprehension difficulty was not significantly related
to differentiation in either direction.

Overview of the Present Research
The present research examines responses from a large and
diverse sample of children (ages 10 –11), adolescents (ages 12–
17), and young adults (ages 18 –20) who completed the BFI, a
well-validated and widely used measure of the Big Five personality trait domains, on the Internet. With these data, we first
examine age trends in the variability of acquiescent responding as
well as the effects of this variability on the characteristics of
youths’ personality self-reports. We then trace the within-domain
coherence, between-domain differentiation, and overall factor
structure of personality self-reports from ages 10 to 20 —and test
whether age trends in coherence and differentiation differ meaningfully by personality domain. Finally, we investigate the role of
verbal comprehension in explaining these patterns.

Method
Sample
Participants were 230,047 volunteers who provided personality
and demographics data over the World Wide Web. All respondents
were between the ages of 10 and 20 (M ⫽ 16.6 years) and were
residents of either the United States (90% of the sample) or Canada
(10%). In preliminary data screening, a small proportion (2.5%) of
cases was eliminated from the final sample because multiple
questions were left unanswered or because the same response was
repeated over and over (cf. Costa & McCrae, 1992; Gosling,
Vazire, Srivastava, & John, 2004).3 This exclusion rate is similar
to what we have observed with undergraduate samples (ages 18 to
23 years) recruited from a research participant pool; in such
samples, exclusion rates have typically varied between 2% and
5%. Even after the elimination of potentially suspect cases, sample
sizes for each specific year of age were large: 1,754 for age 10;
3,590 for age 11; 6,508 for age 12; 14,310 for age 13; 21,152 for
age 14; 27,138 for age 15; 31,272 for age 16; 32,483 for age 17;
36,397 for age 18; 29,317 for age 19; and 26,126 for age 20.4
Compared with non-Internet samples recruited for personality
and social psychology studies published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (Gosling et al., 2004), the present
sample was split more evenly between male and female participants and was at least as diverse in terms of ethnicity. Overall,
60% of respondents were female and 40% were male. Respondents
reported their ethnicity as one of seven categories: 12,540 (5.5%)
were Asian; 7,684 (3.3%) were Black; 9,895 (4.3%) were Latino;
972 (0.4%) were Middle Eastern; 1,468 (0.6%) were Native American; 178,761 (77.7%) were White; 11,865 (5.2%) reported their
ethnicity as Other; and 6,862 (3.0%) did not report their ethnicity.
The sample was also diverse in terms of socioeconomic status.
A question about social class was added during the survey period,
and answers to this question were available for most of the sample.
Of these respondents, 11,866 (9.2%) described their parents’ social
class as working class; 13,586 (10.5%) as lower-middle class;
55,758 (43.2%) as middle class; 43,198 (33.4%) as upper-middle
class; and 4,729 (3.7%) as upper class.
Because of the large sample size, all significance tests of
individual-level (as opposed to group-level) variables were evaluated at the conservative ␣ ⫽ .001 level. Tests of group-level
variables were evaluated at the conventional ␣ ⫽ .05 level.

Procedure and Data Collection
The data analyzed here were collected by Jeff Potter via his Web
site (www.outofservice.com) and made available for scientific
analysis in exchange for authorship. The outofservice.com Web
site offers its visitors free feedback on several surveys and personality measures. Potential respondents could reach this Web site
in a number of ways, including search engines, unsolicited links
from other Web sites, and informal channels, such as e-mail and
online discussion forums.
Many children and adolescents may have difficulty appreciating
the risks and costs of participating in a research procedure, so
special care must be taken to protect the welfare of minor participants in scientific research. For most research involving minors,
this includes obtaining the informed consent of parents for their
child’s participation. Initially, Jeff Potter—a Web entrepreneur
who is not a psychologist or associated with an academic institution— obtained a portion of the present data without seeking
review from an institutional review board (IRB). When the potential significance of this emerging data set became apparent, Oliver
P. John and Samuel D. Gosling obtained separate IRB approvals to
(a) analyze the then-existing data archive and (b) collect new data.
The present research, including a waiver of parental consent, was
approved by two IRBs (a) because the research procedure—
anonymously answering questions about global personality characteristics and receiving general and innocuous feedback—
involves no more than minimal risk to the participants, (b) because
the waiver of consent would not adversely affect the rights or
welfare of the participants, and (c) because the research could not
practicably be carried out without the waiver (United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2005). More generally,
we encourage researchers interested in collecting questionnaire
data from minors, whether over the Internet or by other means, to
carefully consider the welfare of their participants when selecting
the questions to be asked and any feedback to be given.

Measurement
The BFI. The BFI (John et al., 1991; John et al., in press; John
& Srivastava, 1999) was used to obtain personality self-reports.
The 44 BFI items are short, easy-to-understand phrases that assess
personality traits central to each of the Big Five domains. An
3

Exclusion rates varied somewhat by age. For ages 10 to 13, 2.7% of all
cases were excluded because of missing responses, compared with 1.3% of
cases for ages of 14 to 16 and 0.8% of cases for ages of 17 to 20. Similarly,
the proportion of cases excluded for repeatedly selecting the same response
option was 3.1% for ages 10 to 13, 1.5% for ages 14 to 16, and 0.9% for
ages 17 to 20. Thus, aberrant responding was somewhat more common
among younger respondents, but still quite unusual.
4
Data from some respondents younger than age 10 were also available.
However, the fifth-grade reading level of the BFI suggests that this inventory may be too difficult for respondents much younger than age 11.
Indeed, sample sizes decreased rapidly below age 10: Sample size dropped
by more than half from age 10 to age 9, and again from age 9 to age 8.
Younger samples were thus too small to yield reliable PCA results at the
item level. Moreover, for participants as young as age 10, self-selection
concerns are ameliorated by comparisons with findings from other studies,
but previous studies examining age trends in youths’ responses to a Big

YOUTHS’ BIG FIVE SELF-REPORTS

example item from the Extraversion scale is “Is outgoing, sociable”; a reverse-keyed example item from the Neuroticism scale is
“Is emotionally stable, not easily upset.” Each item was rated on a
scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The
brevity of the BFI, and its fifth-grade reading level (BenetMartı́nez & John, 1998), make it well suited to a survey of young
respondents that expects each participant to devote only a limited
amount of time. In adult samples, the BFI scales have shown high
internal consistency, retest reliability, and clear factor structure, as
well as strong convergence with longer Big Five measures (e.g.,
Benet-Martı́nez & John, 1998; John et al., in press; John &
Srivastava, 1999) and substantial agreement between self- and
peer-reports (e.g., DeYoung, 2006; Rammstedt & John, 2007).
Measuring individual differences in acquiescent response style.
Individual differences in acquiescent responding were indexed
with acquiescence scores (within-person response means) computed from a set of 16 pairs of BFI items with opposite implications for personality (e.g., “Is talkative” vs. “Tends to be quiet”;
see the Appendix for a complete list of these pairs as well as
scoring procedures). These pairs were selected by Christopher J.
Soto and Oliver P. John on the basis of item content and interitem
correlations. An acquiescence score was computed for each participant across the 32 items from these pairs (rather than from the
full set of 44 BFI items) because, in the full set, direction of item
keying is confounded with personality content. Specifically, all of
the BFI scales have more true-keyed items than false-keyed items,
although the ratio of true- to false-keyed items varies across scales.
This confound is not present in the set of 16 opposite item pairs,
which equates, for each Big Five domain, the number of truekeyed and false-keyed items.
Ipsatized data: controlling for response style. Ipsatization (or
within-person standardization) is the procedure of transforming
data so that each participant’s set of item responses has the same
mean and standard deviation (e.g., McCrae et al., 2001; Ten Berge,
1999). Many researchers routinely ipsatize their data to control for
individual differences in acquiescent and extreme responding (e.g.,
Ashton et al., 2004; Goldberg, 1990, 1992). Typically, ipsatization
is accomplished by subtracting each participant’s mean response
(across all items) from each of their individual item responses, then
dividing these differences by the standard deviation of that person’s responses. The resulting set of transformed responses has a
mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 for each participant.5 To
avoid confounding response style with personality content (as
described in the previous paragraph), within-person response
means and standard deviations here were computed across the 32
items from the set of 16 opposite-item pairs; these values were
then used to ipsatize the full set of 44 items, as detailed in the
Appendix.
Assessing the comprehension difficulty of the BFI items: item
understandability and trait-word familiarity. Two approaches
were used to assess comprehension difficulties posed by the BFI
items. First, following Angleitner et al. (1986), 13 psychology
graduate students reviewed the BFI items and then judged how
difficult each item would be for a typical 10-year-old to understand. As in Angleitner et al. (1986), psychology students were
used as judges because of their familiarity with personality measures and their general psychological mindedness. These judges
were asked to consider both the semantic and syntactic features of
the items; an easy-to-understand item was defined as one that is

723

clearly written and uses only basic vocabulary (i.e., words that
almost all fourth graders/10-year-olds would know), whereas a
difficult item was defined as one that uses more advanced vocabulary or syntax. Each judge rated each BFI item on a scale ranging
from 1 (very easy to understand) to 7 (very difficult to understand).
Across the set of 44 items, the alpha reliability for the mean of the
13 judges was .93.
A second approach to assessing comprehension difficulty focused exclusively on a semantic aspect of the BFI items, namely
the unfamiliarity of the trait concepts being assessed: Items that
include unfamiliar trait terms are presumably more difficult for
respondents to comprehend. Demonstrating that the familiarity of
trait terms can be assessed reliably, Saucier (1997) collected familiarity ratings for 1,248 person-descriptive adjectives from a
sample of 112 adult community residents and undergraduate psychology students, using a scale ranging from 0 (I don’t know the
meaning of the word) to 9 (I know the meaning of the word and
think it is used extremely often to describe people). The alpha
reliability of these judgments exceeded .90.
The BFI item phrases were derived from trait adjectives that
experts had rated as uniquely prototypical of each Big Five domain
(see John, 1990), and so we were able to index the unfamiliarity of
each item by matching its personality descriptors to Saucier’s
(1997) list of ratings. We reverse-keyed Saucier’s original ratings
so that high scores would indicate unfamiliarity—that is, items that
were more unfamiliar and thus more difficult to comprehend. For
items that included more than one descriptor (e.g., “Is outgoing,
sociable”), we indexed overall unfamiliarity as the mean of all
adjectives for which ratings from Saucier (1997) were available.
For four BFI items (e.g., “Tends to find fault with others”), the
corresponding trait adjectives (e.g., faultfinding) were not included
on the Saucier (1997) list, and so these four items could not be
used in the present analyses of unfamiliarity.
Examples of BFI items that were identified by both understandability and unfamiliarity ratings as particularly difficult are “Is
ingenious, a deep thinker” (difficulty of understanding ⫽ 5.15,
unfamiliarity ⫽ 3.72); “Can be cold and aloof” (difficulty of
understanding ⫽ 5.15, unfamiliarity ⫽ 2.58); and “Likes to reflect,
play with ideas (difficulty of understanding ⫽ 5.08, unfamiliarity ⫽ 3.76). These items clearly include more difficult language
than do three items identified as particularly easy: “Is talkative”
(difficulty of understanding ⫽ 1.23, unfamiliarity ⫽ 1.48); “Is
sometimes rude to others” (difficulty of understanding ⫽ 1.62,
unfamiliarity ⫽ 0.76); and “Tends to be quiet” (difficulty of
understanding ⫽ 1.77, unfamiliarity ⫽ 0.92).
How should these two approaches to defining comprehension
difficulty be related? Note that the difficulty-of-understanding
ratings took into account both the syntax and semantics of the full
item text, whereas the unfamiliarity scores were based only on the
individual trait terms. Moreover, the difficulty-of-understanding
judges focused on the language skills of typical 10-year-olds,
5

Two other methods of controlling for individual differences in acquiescent responding are (a) within-person centering and (b) partialling the
mean response. In the present research, the three methods produced virtually identical results; results from analyses of the ipsatized data are presented here because this is the approach most commonly used in personality research.

SOTO, JOHN, GOSLING, AND POTTER

whereas the adults and undergraduates who judged familiarity in
Saucier’s (1997) research were asked to consider only their own
knowledge of the personality terms. Despite these differences,
difficulty of understanding and unfamiliarity were strongly intercorrelated across the 40 BFI items for which the unfamiliarity
index was available (r ⫽ .48, p ⬍ .05).
We also tested whether these two sets of ratings were sufficiently sensitive to children’s verbal abilities. Three elementary
school teachers particularly familiar with the vocabulary and reading skills of 10- and 11-year-old children rated how difficult it
would be for a typical 10-year-old (fourth grader) to understand
each of the BFI items. Across the 44 items, the means of the
teacher ratings correlated very strongly with the means of the
graduate student ratings (r ⫽ .82, p ⬍ .05). These teacher ratings
also correlated substantially with the unfamiliarity scores derived
from Saucier (1997; r ⫽ .39, p ⬍ .05).6

Gender Differences
In preliminary analyses, we examined differences between the
characteristics of responses made by male and female participants.
At each age, within-domain coherence and between-domain differentiation for males and females differed by no more than two
hundredths of a correlation point. More importantly, age trends in
coherence and differentiation were not substantively different for
male and female participants. Therefore, specific tests of gender
differences are not reported here. Instead, the confounding of age
effects with gender effects was avoided by analyzing male and
female participants separately. In the interest of clarity, all figures
plot age-group values as the unweighted average of the male and
female values.

differences in acquiescent responding) by age group.

Individual Differences in Acquiescent Responding
We hypothesized that younger respondents would show greater
individual differences in their acquiescent response tendencies
than would older respondents. There was considerable variation in
respondents’ acquiescence scores overall, and the extent of this
variation differed systematically by age. Figure 1 shows the variance of the acquiescence scores at each age; higher values indicate
greater individual differences in acquiescent responding. As expected, variance in acquiescence scores was substantially larger in
younger age groups; for Levene’s test for equality of variance,
F(21, 230025) ⫽ 118.15, p ⬍ .001. In fact, as Figure 1 shows,
there was fully twice as much variability in acquiescence at age 10
(variance ⫽ 0.14) as at age 20 (variance ⫽ 0.07).

Principal Component Structure of the BFI Across Ages
The influence of acquiescence variation on eigenvalues. As a
first test for the effects of individual differences in acquiescent
responding on the characteristics of youths’ personality selfreports, we examined eigenvalues from principal components analyses (PCAs) of the raw and ipsatized data conducted separately for
each age group from 10 to 20. Figure 2a presents scree plots for
analyses of the raw data (i.e., acquiescence uncontrolled) at ages
20, 18, 16, 14, 12, and 10; plots for the odd age groups are omitted
because they were very similar to those of adjacent, even ages.

The age-20 plot (i.e., the top panel of Figure 2a) provides an
adult comparison standard.7 This plot indicates a major break after
six components, with five large components presumably representing the Big Five, plus a smaller one presumably representing
individual differences in acquiescence. The first six eigenvalues
are therefore plotted as filled circles, whereas the remaining eig6

Another approach would be to use the structural characteristics of the
BFI items (e.g., average number of words per sentence, average number of
syllables per word) to compute an estimate of comprehension difficulty
(e.g., Flesch–Kincaid grade level; see Benet-Martı́nez & John, 1998).
However, such indices assume reliable structural estimates (i.e., averaged
across many sentences) and so are not well suited to estimating the
difficulty of individual sentences or, worse, the short phrases that constitute
the BFI items. Thus, not surprisingly, when we computed Flesch–Kincaid
reading grade levels for the individual BFI items, these scores were related
only modestly to difficulty of understanding as rated by psychology graduate students (r ⫽ .24) and elementary school teachers (r ⫽ .14) and were
not related at all to adjective familiarity (r ⫽ .00).
7
To be sure that there were no substantial changes in the structure of the
BFI after age 20, we analyzed data from a comparable sample of 30-yearolds (Srivastava et al., 2003). The age-20 and age-30 samples were virtually identical in terms of all measurement characteristics examined in the
present research.

YOUTHS’ BIG FIVE SELF-REPORTS

envalues, representing the “scree” (rubbish variance), are plotted
as open circles.
If the sixth non-scree component indeed represents acquiescent
responding, then this component should have two characteristics.
First, most items should have a small, positive loading on this
component, regardless of their content (e.g., both “Is talkative” and
“Tends to be quiet” should load positively). Indeed, when six
components were extracted and varimax-rotated at age 20, 38 of
the 44 BFI items (86%) had positive loadings on the sixth component.
Second, controlling for individual differences in acquiescence
should effectively remove the additional component. Scree plots
from PCAs of the ipsatized BFI responses (i.e., acquiescence
controlled) are shown in Figure 2b. At age 20 (shown in the top
panel of Figure 2b), there was a substantial break after the first five
eigenvalues (plotted as filled circles); unlike in analyses of the raw
data (Figure 2a), there was no clear break after the sixth component. That is, ipsatizing the data to control for individual differences in acquiescent responding effectively removed the extra
component found in PCAs of the raw data.
As Figure 2 shows, this pattern of six non-scree components in
the raw data and five non-scree components in the ipsatized data
was generally consistent across age groups but was qualified by
two important trends. One trend is that, as shown in Figure 2a,
the separation of the five expected components from the sixth,
extra component in the raw data was smallest—indeed, practically non-existent—at age 10, then increased systematically to
age 20. This effect can be quantified by using the difference
between the fifth and sixth eigenvalues, which was only 0.12 at
age 10 but increased to 1.30 by age 20; across the full age range,
this difference correlated .98 with age group. This trend is
consistent with the hypothesis that individual differences in
acquiescent responding have larger structural effects at younger
ages.
A second developmental trend is that the five expected components accounted for a much larger proportion of the total
variance in the older age groups. At age 10, the first five
components in the ipsatized data (see Figure 2b) accounted for
34% of the total variance, which increased to 45% by age 20 —a
gain of approximately one-third. Across the full age range, the
correlation between the variance accounted for by the first five
components and age group was .96. This trend suggests that,
even after controlling for individual differences in acquiescence, the BFI’s intended five-factor structure may be recovered more clearly at older ages.
Five-component solutions. As noted above, at age 10 the scree
plot for the raw data suggested six non-scree components (see
Figure 2a). By contrast, once acquiescence was controlled through
ipsatization, the plot indicated only five non-scree components
(see Figure 2b). The presence of an extra acquiescence component
in the raw data raises the question of whether the familiar Big Five
structure could be recovered at age 10 if individual differences in
acquiescent responding were not first controlled. To address this
question, and to further examine the effects of variation in acquiescent responding on the overall structure of the BFI, we varimaxrotated five components in the raw and in the ipsatized data for
each specific age group from 10 to 20.
At age 20, the intended Big Five structure was very clearly
recovered in varimax-rotated five-component solutions, as in pre-

725

vious research using the BFI with college-aged samples (e.g.,
Benet-Martı́nez & John, 1998; John & Srivastava, 1999). In both
the raw and ipsatized data, each of the 44 BFI items had its largest
loading on its intended component, and these loadings were substantial in size, with absolute values averaging .63.
This five-dimensional structure was also clearly recovered
throughout middle and late adolescence. However, it was recovered much less clearly in early adolescence and was not
recognizable at age 10 when individual differences in acquiescence were not controlled. Consider first the congruence coefficients presented in Table 1, which compare the five components at each age with the corresponding components from our
age-20 standard. In general, high congruence coefficients indicate that the two components being compared have similar
patterns of loadings across the 44 BFI items, with congruence
of 1 indicating perfect similarity of relative loadings. The left
half of Table 1 presents congruence coefficients for the raw
data. Going backwards from age 19, congruence with the
age-20 solution declined gradually from early adulthood
through middle adolescence. However, even as far back as age
13, all five coefficients were at least .96, and inspection of the
loading matrix indicated that at this age 43 of the 44 BFI
items (98%) still had their strongest loading on the intended
component.
Age differences in congruence for the raw data were much more
pronounced below age 13. As shown in Table 1, three of the five
congruence coefficients (for Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and
Neuroticism) declined rapidly from age 13 to age 10. Similarly, the
number of items that had their strongest loading on the intended
component decreased to 42 items (95%) at age 12, to 38 (86%) at
age 11, and to only 34 (77%) at age 10. Indeed, at age 10, the
intended Conscientiousness and Neuroticism dimensions were not
recovered. Instead, one of the five rotated components was defined
by the five high-Conscientiousness items and three lowNeuroticism items, along with a low-Openness item and a lowExtraversion item; another component was defined by the four
low-Conscientiousness items, the five high-Neuroticism items, and
a low-Extraversion item.
As the congruence coefficients for the ipsatized data (in the right
half of Table 1) show, controlling for individual differences in
acquiescence greatly aided recovery of the intended Big Five
structure. Going backwards in age, congruence declined very gradually from early adulthood into early adolescence; even at age 13,
congruence was at least .97 for each component. As in the raw
data, the five factors were recovered less clearly in late childhood
than in adolescence and early adulthood, and year-to-year differences in congruence were largest during late childhood. However,
unlike in the raw data, the Big Five structure was recognizable in
the ipsatized data even at age 10; at this age, congruence coefficients were at least .93 for each of the five components, and 43 of
the 44 items (98%) already had their strongest loading on the
intended component.
The high congruence coefficients for the ipsatized data indicate
that, after controlling for individual differences in acquiescence, the
patterns of relative loadings in varimax-rotated PCA solutions were
quite similar across late childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood.
Nonetheless, the item loading matrices indicated considerable room
for improvement with age in terms of absolute loading sizes. Even in
the ipsatized data, the magnitude of the 44 intended primary loadings

variance terms, this means that a typical BFI item shared only 27% of

Taken together, these PCA results attest to the substantial
influence of variation in acquiescent responding on youths’
personality self-reports, particularly during late childhood.

style were controlled, the overall Big Five structure of the BFI
was recognizable even at age 10. However, substantial age
differences in the patterns of eigenvalues and the absolute sizes
of component loadings point to meaningful developmental
trends beyond those due to variability in acquiescent responding. Therefore, we now turn from overall structure to indices of
more specific measurement characteristics, namely withindomain coherence and between-domain differentiation.

expected that the presence of individual differences in acquiescent
responding would modestly inflate within-domain coherence. Indeed, Figure 3a shows that overall coherence (averaged across
gender and across the five BFI scales) was slightly higher in the
raw data than in the ipsatized data, with differences of .01 or .02.
At the level of individual scales (not shown in Figure 3a), differences ranged from –.01 to .04 and were largest for Openness—the
least balanced BFI scale. Consistent with the hypothesis that
individual differences in acquiescent responding would have stronger effects at younger ages, the overall degree of positive bias was
larger at younger ages; the correlation of group age with the
magnitude of the difference in coherence between the raw and
ipsatized data was –.69.
General age trend. As expected, even after controlling for
individual differences in response style, overall coherence was
higher at older ages. In the ipsatized data (see Figure 3a), coherence increased from .23 at age 10 to .36 at age 20, meaning that a
typical pair of items on the same BFI scale shared only 5% of their
variance at age 10 but shared 13% at age 20 —a gain of 160%. The
correlation between group age and coherence was .97. Figure 3a
also shows that age gains in coherence were generally large during
late childhood and early adolescence, then much smaller at older
ages.

Between-Domain Differentiation
Overall differentiation among the Big Five domains at each age
was indexed by the mean of the 10 possible pairwise intercorrelations among the five BFI scales; lower values indicate that scores
on each scale were better differentiated from scores on other
scales. Because interscale correlations are attenuated by measurement error, which differed as a function of age (see Figure 3a), all
pairwise interscale correlations were corrected for attenuation due
to unreliability.8
Influence of variation in acquiescent responding. Because the
BFI scales all have more true- than false-keyed items, the presence
of individual differences in acquiescent responding should positively bias interscale correlations, hurting differentiation. Indeed,
Figure 3b shows that overall differentiation (averaged across gender) was slightly worse in the raw data than in the ipsatized data,
with differences ranging from .02 to .06. Supporting the hypothesis

that individual differences in acquiescence have stronger effects at
younger ages, this bias was larger at younger ages; the correlation
of age with the magnitude of difference between differentiation in
the raw and ipsatized data was –.98.
General age trend. As predicted, Figure 3b also shows that
overall differentiation was better at older ages. In the ipsatized
data, the mean interscale correlation decreased from .30 at age 10
to .18 at age 20, meaning that a typical pair of BFI scales shared
9% of their variance at age 10 but only 3% at age 20 —a decrease
of two-thirds. The correlation between group age and the mean
interscale correlation was –.89. Gains in differentiation were generally large during late childhood and early adolescence, then
smaller or even nonexistent during late adolescence.

Domain-Specific Age Trends in Coherence and
Differentiation
Averaged across personality trait domains, within-domain coherence and between-domain differentiation were better at older
ages. However, just as the main effects in a factorial analysis of
variance cannot be interpreted without considering interaction
effects, these overall age trends in coherence and differentiation
need to be qualified by differences among the five personality
domains—akin to age by domain interaction effects. Toward this
end, Figure 4 presents coherence and differentiation, both computed in the ipsatized data at each age, separately for each of the
Big Five domains.9 As this figure shows, the domains differed
substantially from each other in their age trends for both coherence
and differentiation.
8
Age trends were similar for raw correlations and disattenuated correlations. However, the presence of greater error variance at younger ages
depressed raw correlations, thereby dampening the trend of better differentiation with age.
9
The mean interitem correlations plotted in Figure 4a correspond to
Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for the Extraversion scale of .64 at age 10
and .87 at age 20; for Agreeableness, .76 at age 10 and .78 at age 20; for
Conscientiousness, .76 at age 10 and .80 at age 20; for Neuroticism, .73 at
age 10 and .82 at age 20; and for Openness, .57 at age 10 and .75 at age
20.

ipsatized data (acquiescence controlled) by age group. All mean correlations are averaged across the five Big
Five Inventory scales by using the Fisher r-to-z transformation.

Extraversion. As predicted, Extraversion showed the largest
increase in coherence from age 10 to age 20, a difference of .28 for
male participants and .26 for female participants ( ps ⬍ .001).10
However, this dramatic age gain was specific to coherence; Extraversion was already well-differentiated from the other BFI
scales even at the youngest ages and did not show a significant
gain in differentiation with age.
Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. As predicted, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness showed the largest age differences
in between-domain differentiation. For Agreeableness (represented
by filled triangles in Figure 4b), the difference between the differentiation index at age 10 and at age 20 was –.23 for male
participants and –.17 for female participants ( ps ⬍ .001); for
Conscientiousness (empty triangles in Figure 4), this difference
was –.19 for male participants and –.20 for female participants
( ps ⬍ .001). In fact, of the 10 possible pairwise interscale correlations, that between Agreeableness and Conscientiousness
showed the largest decrease from age 10 to age 20 —a difference
of –.34 for male participants and –.36 for female participants
( ps ⬍ .001). By contrast, Agreeableness did not show a significant
age gain in coherence, and Conscientiousness showed only a trivial
one; for both male and female participants, the difference between
age 10 and age 20 was .05 ( ps ⬍ .001).
Openness and Neuroticism. We hypothesized that, on average,
the items of the BFI Openness scale would be relatively difficult to
comprehend and therefore that Openness would show particularly
large age gains in coherence. Consistent with this expectation,
Table 2 shows that Openness items were, on average, the most

difficult to comprehend, as judged by both the unfamiliarity and
difficulty-of-understanding indices. Planned contrasts comparing
Openness with the other four scales were statistically significant
for both difficulty of understanding, F(1, 39) ⫽ 5.70, p ⬍ .05; and
unfamiliarity, F(1, 35) ⫽ 3.93, p ⬍ .05. However, as Table 2 also
shows, the difficulty of the BFI items also varied considerably
within each Big Five domain; for both indices, the ranges of all
five scales overlapped with each other.
Regarding age trends in measurement properties, Openness did
show substantial age differences in both coherence and differentiation, but the trends for this domain were quite similar to those
for Neuroticism, the scale that was judged least difficult to comprehend by both indices. As shown in Figures 4c and 4d, age gains
in coherence were moderate in magnitude both for Openness,
which increased from age 10 to age 20 by .11 for male participants
and .15 for female participants ( ps ⬍ .001), and for Neuroticism,

10
Here and elsewhere, the statistical significance of age differences in
mean interitem correlations and mean interscale correlations was tested
with a procedure developed by Feldt (1969) to test the null hypothesis that
Cronbach’s alpha coefficient is the same for two scales in two different
groups. When the number of pairwise intercorrelations for the two scales
is the same (as is the case when comparing the same BFI scale— or the
correlations of one BFI scale with the other four scales—in two different
age groups), this procedure is equivalent to testing the null hypothesis that
the mean intercorrelation is the same for the two groups.

coherence of personality self-reports are simply due to verbal
comprehension. However, comparisons at this level of analysis
could be made only with an effective sample size of five—the five
domain scales. To investigate more sensitively the relation between comprehension difficulty and coherence, we also conducted
analyses at the item level. Specifically, we tested whether more
difficult BFI items showed (a) less within-domain coherence at
young ages and (b) larger age gains in coherence than easier items
showed. To conduct these item-level tests, we indexed coherence
as the corrected item–total correlation, a statistic that reflects the
extent to which an individual item correlates with the mean of the
other items on its scale.
Table 3 presents correlations between (a) item-level withindomain coherence at age 10 and at age 20 (separately for male and
female participants), (b) gain in coherence from age 10 to age 20
(separately for male and female participants), and (c) the two
indices of item-comprehension difficulty. Correlations involving
unfamiliarity were computed across the 40 items for which unfamiliarity ratings were available; all other correlations were com-

puted across the full set of 44 BFI items. These correlations
illustrate three key points. First, the robustness of the item-level
coherence index is evidenced by its strong cross-gender generalizability correlations at age 10 (r ⫽ .92), at age 20 (r ⫽ .95), and
for the gain from age 10 to age 20 (r ⫽ .90). These high correlations indicate that the most and least coherent items, and the items
that showed the largest and smallest age gains in coherence, were
very similar for male and female participants.
Second, item-level coherence showed negative associations
with the two indices of comprehension difficulty at both age 10
and age 20; these correlations, presented in the two bottom rows
of Table 3, were modest to moderate in size, ranging from –.11
to –.34. Although these correlations did not all reach conventional levels of statistical significance with samples of 40 or 44
items, together they imply that both children and adults had
somewhat more trouble responding coherently to difficult items
than to easy items.
Third, correlations (shown in the lower right corner of Table 3)

sion difficulty were uniformly modest in magnitude and not statistically significant. In other words, items that were more difficult
to comprehend did not show much larger age gains in coherence
than did easy items.11 Taken together, the correlations presented in
Table 3 imply that, although comprehension plays a role in determining the coherence of youths’ personality self-reports, developmental trends in coherence cannot simply be attributed to children’s difficulty in understanding the items.

General Discussion
What Have We Learned? Findings and Implications
The influence of individual differences in acquiescent responding on personality self-reports is particularly strong in childhood
and early adolescence. Psychometricians have long cautioned
that uncontrolled variation in acquiescent responding can have
adverse effects on the validity of personality questionnaires (Jackson & Messick, 1958). Going beyond previous research, the
present findings indicate that the consequences of acquiescence
variation are particularly dire for ratings provided by children and
early adolescents. These age groups showed much greater individual differences in acquiescence than did older adolescents and
adults: There was fully twice as much variance in acquiescence
scores at age 10 as at age 20. Moreover, prior to age 14, acquiescence variation had especially strong effects on the coherence,
differentiation, and overall factor structure of the BFI. Indeed,
when individual differences in acquiescence were not controlled,
the BFI’s intended factor structure could not be recovered at
age 10.
In view of these findings, we recommend that when researchers
examine self-reports provided by children and early adolescents,
they control for individual differences in acquiescent responding.
This is particularly important when conducting analyses at the item
level or when using scales with an imbalance of true- and falsekeyed items. This control can be accomplished by way of ipsatization (as we have done here), within-person centering, or partialling the within-person mean response (see Ten Berge, 1999).
Whichever method is chosen, however, care must be taken to
ensure that acquiescence is assessed and removed while preserving
the substantive content of youths’ self-reports (e.g., by computing
acquiescence scores from a set of semantically opposite item pairs,
rather than across all available items) and that validity is thus
enhanced rather than reduced.
Some groups of respondents as young as age 10 can provide
structurally valid Big Five self-reports. We found that, after
controlling for variation in acquiescence, the intended five-factor
structure of the BFI was recognizable in each specific age group
from 10 to 20 years. Previous studies have recovered versions of
the NEO-FFI’s intended structure from the self-reports of smaller
samples as young as age 12 (Allik et al., 2004; McCrae et al.,
2002; Parker & Stumpf, 1998). At ages younger than this, special
interview techniques have been needed to obtain reliable reports
(Measelle, John, Ablow, Cowan, & Cowan, 2005). The present
research, using a large and diverse sample of respondents, as well
as a non-NEO instrument, extends to age 10 the lower bound at

which the Big Five structure can be recovered from questionnaire
self-reports.
There are important age differences in the characteristics of
youths’ personality self-reports— beyond those attributable to acquiescence—and these age differences vary substantially across
personality domains. We tested whether there were age differences in the coherence and differentiation of youths’ personality
self-reports after individual differences in response style were
controlled and— going beyond previous research—whether age
trends in coherence and differentiation varied by personality domain. Averaging across the Big Five domains, we found substantial age gains in both coherence and differentiation. Analyses of
coherence showed that a typical pair of items on the same BFI
scale shared more than twice as much variance at age 20 as at age
10. Similarly, analyses of differentiation showed that a typical pair
of BFI scales overlapped three times as much at age 10 as at age
20. These pronounced age differences strongly caution against the
assumption that, from a measurement perspective, youths’ selfreports can be considered equivalent to those of adults (cf. McCrae
et al., 2002).
Looking more closely, we found that these aggregate age trends
in coherence and differentiation (i.e., main effects of age) masked
substantial variation among the age trends of different Big Five
domains (i.e., age by domain interaction effects). Extraversion
showed the largest age gain in coherence: Two typical Extraversion items shared more than six times as much variance at age 20
as they did at age 10. Yet Extraversion was already well differentiated from the other four domains at the youngest ages studied. By
contrast, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness showed only trivial
age gains in coherence but became much better differentiated with
age, particularly from each other: The overlap between these two
scales was eight times as large at age 10 as it was at age 20.
Finally, Openness and Neuroticism showed moderate age gains in
both coherence and differentiation.
Note that most of the Big Five domains showed rather different
age trends for coherence than they did for differentiation. Indeed,
some domains showed an increase only in coherence or only in
differentiation. Importantly, this pattern of findings indicates that
age differences in these two characteristics of youths’ personality
self-reports are not both caused by a single developmental process;
multiple factors must be at work.
Developmental trends in the coherence of youths’ personality
self-reports are not simply due to verbal comprehension. Another novel contribution of the present research is its consideration
of the comprehension difficulties that personality questionnaires
may pose for children and adolescents. By identifying BFI items
and scales that are particularly easy or difficult for younger respondents to understand, we were able to test whether age differences in the coherence of BFI self-reports were simply due to
11
To check whether the modest size of these associations was an artifact
of using difference scores, we also performed GLM analyses with age and
gender as within-subject (i.e., within-BFI-item) factors and comprehension
difficulty as a between-subject (i.e., between-item) factor; in each of these
analyses, the interaction between age and comprehension difficulty was not
significant, indicating that the effect of age did not differ strongly for easy
versus difficult items. Also, redoing these correlational and GLM analyses
by using Flesch–Kincaid reading grade levels as the index of comprehension difficulty (see Footnote 6) produced similar but weaker results.

verbal comprehension difficulties. At the scale level, we found that
Openness—the domain with the most difficult items— did show a
substantial age gain in coherence, yet Extraversion, a scale with
substantially easier items, showed a much larger gain. At the item
level, more difficult items showed somewhat less coherence than
did easier items— but that was true at both age 10 and age
20 —and more difficult items did not show especially large age
gains in coherence. These results imply that, at least for a generally
easy-to-comprehend measure like the BFI, comprehension is not
the major determinant of developmental trends in the coherence of
youths’ personality self-reports.

Limitations and Future Directions
Generalizability across populations, measures, and methods of
administration. In order to obtain the large sample size needed to
compare coherence, differentiation, and factor structure across
specific age groups, participants in the present research were
recruited passively and completed a particular personality measure, the BFI, over the Internet. To what extent are the present
findings generalizable to other populations, measures, and methods of administration?
Passive recruitment, although necessary to obtain the large
sample size required for the present research, introduces the possibility of self-selection effects. The present participants, especially those in the younger age groups (where sample sizes were
smaller), may not be fully representative of the general population
in terms of their capacity to provide valid self-reports. Instead,
passive recruitment of our sample probably selected for, at least to
some extent, children who were particularly motivated and able to
respond to a personality questionnaire. Note, however, that this
kind of selection bias would not create the kind of age effects
reported here; instead, it would dampen any age differences in
measurement characteristics. Thus, the age trends in acquiescence
variability, within-domain coherence, and between-domain differentiation observed in the present sample may underestimate the
population trends.
Regarding generalizability across measures, some of our findings may not apply to personality instruments very different from
the BFI. Specifically, the effect of verbal comprehension on coherence may be stronger for measures that include items more
difficult for young respondents to understand. Similarly, we would
expect less clear factor structures for measures that include many
difficult items, or items irrelevant to young respondents (e.g.,
questions about marriage, career, or civic duties). Moreover, commonly used Big Five measures differ somewhat in their construct
definitions, especially for Openness and Extraversion (John et al.,
in press; John & Srivastava, 1999). Such differences may affect the
exact nature of domain-specific developmental trends in coherence
and differentiation.
Regarding methods of administration, there is now good evidence that Internet, paper-and-pencil, and face-to-face assessment
procedures produce similar results in college-aged and adult samples (Buchanan & Smith, 1999; Gosling et al., 2004; McGraw,
Tew, & Williams, 2000; Robins, Trzesniewski, Tracy, Gosling, &
Potter, 2002; Skitka & Sargis, 2006; Srivastava, John, Gosling, &
Potter, 2003) and that paper-and-pencil, proctored computer, and
unproctored Internet versions of personality questionnaires have
very similar measurement properties (Chuah, Drasgow, & Roberts,

733

2006). Much less is known, however, about the characteristics of
questionnaires administered to young respondents with different
methods.
These concerns about generalizability are ameliorated by the
fact that some of our results are consistent with previous research
that has examined the characteristics of adolescents’ personality
self-reports—research that has sampled from very different populations, focused mostly on a different measure, namely the NEOFFI, and used paper-and-pencil administration. For example, our
finding that most measurement properties reach asymptote by late
adolescence is consistent with the results of a previous study that
administered an Estonian translation of the NEO-FFI via paper and
pencil in a secondary school setting (Allik et al., 2004). Moreover,
the integrity of our Internet administration is evidenced by the very
small percentage of cases (less than 3% of all those available)
eliminated from analysis due to evidence of indifferent or random
responding. Nevertheless, results from the present research should
be taken to indicate that some groups of children and adolescents
are able to provide coherent and differentiated personality selfreports with some instruments. They do not imply, of course, that
all questionnaires are appropriate for use with all child and adolescent samples, nor that Internet and paper-and-pencil administration are exactly equivalent for young respondents.
Further research is needed to examine variables, beyond chronological age and item comprehension, that define groups of
youths who can and cannot provide coherent and differentiated
personality self-reports. One study from the adult personality literature suggested that the hierarchical versus non-hierarchical
structure of concepts may be one such variable (Toomela, 2003;
see also Allik & McCrae, 2004). In this study, the five-factor
structure of the NEO PI-R was clearly recovered in groups of
Estonian men who showed “scientific concepts” thinking (i.e.,
hierarchical classification of concepts) but was not recognizable
among those who showed “everyday concepts” thinking (i.e.,
non-hierarchical classification).
An even lower age limit for personality questionnaire selfreports. The present research provides evidence that some children as young as age 10 can provide coherent and differentiated
personality self-reports on a questionnaire that—although relatively easy to understand—was developed primarily for use with
adult samples. Results from one previous study suggest that, by
using a special puppet-interview procedure, reliable and valid Big
Five self-reports begin to emerge between ages 5 and 7 (Measelle
et al., 2005). Taken together, these findings raise the question of
whether children even younger than age 10 can provide valid
self-reports on personality questionnaires— especially on those
developed specifically to assess personality in childhood (e.g.,
Mervielde & De Fruyt, 2002).
Continued efforts to develop child-appropriate personality selfreport measures are thus needed. Such research can help investigate the features of personality questionnaires, including overall
ease of comprehension and relevance for children and adolescents,
that make questionnaires particularly well or poorly suited for
younger populations (cf. Angleitner et al., 1986; Goldberg, 1963)
as well as directly test the equivalence of Internet versus paperand-pencil administration of questionnaires to young respondents.

ality self-reports, longitudinal research is needed to directly test
hypotheses about the developmental mechanisms underlying these
trends. For example, longitudinal data are needed to rule out cohort
effects as an explanation for age differences in measurement
characteristics.
The findings of the present research can inform such future
work in at least three ways. First, more research is needed to study
how youths’ understanding of personality trait terms is related to
their capacity to provide valid personality self-reports. Across the
BFI items, the present research found only a modest link between
trait-word familiarity and the coherence of personality self-reports
in late childhood and adolescence. This result, however, is
bounded both by the age range studied and by the content of the
BFI and should thus be regarded as the first word—rather than the
last— on the link between comprehension and self-report validity.
Second, the finding that coherence and differentiation showed
different developmental trends for most personality domains suggests that more than a single developmental factor is at work, and
that the most important influences on coherence and differentiation
are likely domain-specific ones. In particular, further research is
needed to test whether the dramatic age gains documented here in
the coherence of Extraversion self-reports are due to changes in the
underlying structure of this trait domain from childhood to adulthood. Research is also needed to further investigate the hypothesis
that age gains in the differentiation of youths’ self-reports on
Agreeableness and Conscientiousness are influenced by their increasingly complex understandings of different ways to be good or
bad, to do right or wrong.
Third, the present research found that age differences in measurement properties were much larger from ages 10 to 14 than at
later ages. This finding indicates that late childhood and early
adolescence are key periods in the development of the capacity to
report about one’s own personality. Future research should focus
specifically on this age range.
The basic structure of personality traits in childhood and adolescence. The present research was designed, most centrally, to
address questions about developmental trends in the characteristics
of personality self-reports from late childhood to adulthood. To
best meet this aim, we obtained self-reports by using the same
personality instrument in each age group of our sample—an instrument that is generally easy to understand, assesses traits relevant to children and adolescents, and has a clear multidimensional
structure by early adulthood. We did not use different instruments
at different ages. Put another way, we adopted the developmental
analogue of an etic, rather than emic, measurement approach
(Berry, 1969; Paunonen, 2000). For our purposes, this etic approach had the necessary feature of separating age effects from
method effects: If we instead had adopted an emic approach and
used different measures at different ages, we could not be sure that
any observed age trends in measurement characteristics reflected
developmental changes rather than the idiosyncrasies of the different age-specific instruments.
By contrast, the present approach is less well suited for addressing questions about whether the basic structure of personality traits
differs by age. More specifically, basic trait structure is only one of
several factors that likely influenced the structure of BFI selfreports documented here; other influences likely include agerelated cognitive capacities as well as the “built-in” Big Five
structure of the BFI itself. For these reasons, our conclusions

regarding basic structure must be cautious: First, certain of the
present findings (e.g., the pronounced age gain in coherence for
Extraversion) provide some support for the view that the basic
structure of personality traits changes over the course of childhood
and adolescence (Eaton, 1994; John et al., 1994; van Lieshout &
Haselager, 1994). Second, the rather clear five-factor structure that
we obtained even at age 10 does not prove that the Big Five
constitutes a comprehensive set of basic personality dimensions in
late childhood. Thus, there is a need for more research designed to
directly address the issue of basic structure (e.g., Goldberg, 2001;
Halverson et al., 2003; John et al., 1994; Kohnstamm et al., 1998;
van Lieshout & Haselager, 1994).
The external validity of youths’ self-reports. The present research carefully examined whether youths’ Big Five self-reports
conform to the familiar five-factor structure (they do, once individual differences in acquiescence are taken into account) and
whether the characteristics of these self-reports differ by age and
domain (they do, even beyond the effects of acquiescence). Now,
knowing that personality self-reports show some structural validity
even by age 10, future studies should examine external validity.
Adult descriptions of youths’ personalities are known to predict
important social, academic, and mental health outcomes (e.g.,
Halverson et al., 2003; John et al., 1994). Are youths’ self-reports
also predictive of these outcomes? Is some of the predictive power
provided by youths’ self-reports unique from that of adults’ descriptions? Does the external validity of youths’ self-reports increase with age? Future research could obtain external data from
smaller samples to answer these questions.

Conclusion
Taken as a whole, the present findings provide encouragement
for researchers interested in obtaining psychological self-reports
from children and adolescents. At the same time, they caution
against the assumption that, from a measurement perspective,
youths’ self-reports are equivalent to those of adults. Our own
view is that questionnaire self-reports from children and adolescents— obtained while safeguarding the welfare of young respondents and interpreted in light of age differences in the characteristics of such reports—are a source of information that is too often
neglected. Because descriptions provided by parents or teachers
are based on limited information (i.e., only the child’s overt actions
in the classroom or at home) and may be biased by an adult-centric
construal of child behavior, youths’ self-reports provide a unique
and valuable window into psychological development during late
childhood and adolescence.

Computing the Content-Balanced Acquiescence Index and Ipsatizing the BFI Items
As described in the Method section, we indexed each person’s
level of acquiescence as their mean response to a set of 16 pairs of
BFI items with opposite implications for personality (e.g., item 1,
“Is talkative,” vs. item 21, “Tends to be quiet”). Standard BFI item
numbers (Benet-Martı́nez & John, 1998; John et al., in press; John
& Srivastava, 1999) for the 16 pairs of opposite items are as
follows: 1 and 21, 6 and 16, 31 and 36, 2 and 17, 7 and 12, 27 and
42, 32 and 37, 3 and 43, 8 and 13, 18 and 33, 23 and 28, 9 and 19,
24 and 29, 34 and 39, 5 and 35, and 30 and 41. The SPSS syntax
presented below first computes, for each person, an acquiescence
score (the mean of their 16 ⫻ 2 ⫽ 32 item responses) and a
response extremeness score (the standard deviation of their 32 item
responses). These two scores are then used to ipsatize the person’s
full set of 44 BFI item responses. The syntax assumes that the
variables for the 44 BFI items are named bfi1 to bfi44 in standard
order.
