In 2 experiments participants named pictures of common objects with superimposed distractor words. In
one naming condition, the pictures and words were presented simultaneously on every trial, and
participants produced the target response immediately. In the other naming condition, the presentation of
the picture preceded the presentation of the distractor by 1,000 ms, and participants delayed production
of their naming response until distractor word presentation. Within each naming condition, the distractor
words were either semantic category coordinates of the target pictures or unrelated. Orthogonal to this
manipulation of semantic relatedness, the frequency of the pictures’ names was manipulated. The authors
observed semantic interference effects in both the immediate and delayed naming conditions but a
frequency effect only in the immediate naming condition. These data indicate that semantic interference
can be observed when target picture naming latencies do not reflect the bottleneck at the level of lexical
selection. In the context of other findings from the picture–word interference paradigm, the authors
interpret these data as supporting the view that the semantic interference effect arises at a postlexical level
of processing.

ence effect (e.g., Lupker, 1979; Rosinski, 1977): Naming a picture
of an object (e.g., CAR) is slower in the context of a semantic
category coordinate distractor word (e.g., truck) compared to an
unrelated distractor word (e.g., table). The explanation of the
semantic interference effect in terms of lexical selection by competition assumes that semantic category coordinate distractors lead
to more highly activated lexical representations than do unrelated
distractors.1
Recently, the assumption that lexical selection is a competitive
process has been challenged. A number of studies have observed
semantic facilitation effects when target pictures and distractor
words are semantically related. For example, naming a picture of
an object (e.g., CAR) is (a) faster in the context of a semantically
related verb distractor (e.g., drive) compared to an unrelated verb
distractor (e.g., read; Mahon, Costa, Peterson, Vargas, & Caramazza, 2007), (b) faster in the context of a distractor word that
refers to a part of the target object (e.g., engine) compared to an
unrelated distractor (e.g., branches; Costa, Alario, & Caramazza,
2005), (c) faster in the context of a within-category semantically
close distractor word (e.g., truck) compared to a within-category
semantically far distractor word (e.g., wagon; Mahon et al., 2007;
but see Vigliocco, Vinson, Lewis, & Garrett, 2004), and (d) faster
in the context of a masked semantic category coordinate distractor

A central question in language production research concerns the
dynamical principles that govern the mechanism responsible for
retrieving words from the mental lexicon. A widespread assumption in language production models is that lexical selection is a
competitive process (e.g., La Heij, 1988; Levelt, Roelofs, &
Meyer, 1999; Roelofs, 2003). The hypothesis of lexical selection
by competition proposes that the time it takes to select a target
word increases as the levels of activation of nontarget words
increase. The primary source of empirical evidence cited in support of lexical selection by competition is the semantic interfer-

This is because lexical representations of semantic category coordinate
distractors receive activation from two sources (the picture and word),
whereas those of unrelated distractors receive activation from only one
source (the word).

word (e.g., truck) compared to a masked unrelated distractor (e.g.,
table; Finkbeiner & Caramazza, 2006). (This list is nonexhaustive;
for a review of semantic facilitation effects, see Mahon et al.,
2007.) If lexical selection were by competition, one would have
expected semantic interference effects—not facilitation effects—in the studies cited above.
An alternative to lexical selection by competition is the view
that the highest activated lexical node is selected, without regard to
the levels of activation of nontarget lexical nodes (e.g., Caramazza,
1997; Dell, 1986; Stemberger, 1985).2 If one adopted such a model
of lexical selection then the range of semantic facilitation effects
that have been reported in the literature would follow as a natural
consequence (Costa et al., 2005; Finkbeiner & Caramazza, 2006;
Mahon et al., 2007). Specifically, such semantic facilitation effects
would arise as a result of semantic priming between distractor
words and target pictures. However, if one assumed that the
semantic facilitation effects arise during lexical selection, one
would be compelled to assume that the semantic interference effect
arises at a different level of processing. It is thus clear that the
semantic interference effect would constitute evidence for the
hypothesis of lexical selection by competition only if there is
independent reason to believe that the phenomenon reflects a
lexical-level process.

The Response Exclusion Hypothesis
Spoken language permits only a single word to be produced at
a given time. It must therefore be the case that at a suitably
peripheral level of processing, spoken language production involves a single-channel output buffer. It is also known that aurally
and visually presented words have a privileged relationship to the
articulators in a way that pictures do not (e.g., Roelofs, 2003). It
follows that in the situation presented by the picture–word interference paradigm, written or aurally presented distractor words
will be available to the articulators sooner than the names of the
target pictures. Thus, in a given picture naming event in the
picture–word interference paradigm, a production-ready representation corresponding to the distractor word must be purged from
the single-channel output buffer before the name of the picture can
be produced. Consistent with this analysis, recent work has suggested that part of the variance in naming latencies observed in the
picture–word interference paradigm arises at a postlexical level.
For instance, Miozzo and Caramazza (2003) had participants name
pictures of objects (e.g., CAR) in the context of low frequency
(e.g., spleen) and high frequency (e.g., school) distractor words.
Picture naming latencies were faster in the context of high frequency distractor words compared to low frequency distractor
words. The distractor frequency effect can be explained if it is
assumed that high frequency words are available for exclusion
from production sooner than low frequency words.
A recent proposal for explaining the semantic interference effect
at a postlexical level of processing is the response exclusion
hypothesis (Finkbeiner & Caramazza, 2006; Mahon et al., 2007).
The central claim of the response exclusion hypothesis is that the
decision process responsible for excluding nontarget words from
the single-channel output buffer has semantically interpreted information at its disposal. Such semantically interpreted information would be, for instance, the provenance (word or picture) or the
coarse semantic category of a production-ready representation

(e.g., “animal”). In this framework, the semantic interference effect arises because unrelated distractors can be excluded from
production relatively sooner than distractor words corresponding
to semantic category coordinates of the target pictures. For example, when naming a picture of a CAR, the semantically related
distractor word truck satisfies the semantic criterion of naming a
vehicle, whereas the unrelated distractor word table does not
satisfy this response-relevant criterion (for discussion of response
relevant criteria, see also Hantsch, Jescheniak, & Schriefers, 2005;
Kuipers, La Heij, & Costa, 2006; for the first systematic treatment
of response relevant factors, see Lupker, 1979; Lupker & Katz,
1981).
The response exclusion hypothesis and the hypothesis of lexical
selection by competition make different assumptions regarding the
locus of the semantic interference effect. According to the hypothesis of lexical selection by competition, the semantic interference
effect arises at the level of lexical selection. According to the
response exclusion hypothesis, the semantic interference effect
arises at a postlexical level of processing. One way to distinguish
between a lexical and a postlexical locus of the semantic interference effect is to test whether semantic interference is observed
when participants delay their picture naming responses. In a delayed picture naming task, naming latencies to target pictures will
not reflect the bottleneck at the level of lexical selection but rather
the bottleneck at the single-channel output buffer. We can thus
derive the following predictions. If the semantic interference effect
arises at the level of lexical selection, then the semantic interference effect will not be observed when participants delay their
picture naming responses. However, if the semantic interference
effect arises at a postlexical level of processing, then semantic
interference should be observed in a delayed naming task.
We tested these predictions in two experiments. Both experiments consisted of an immediate and a delayed naming condition.
In the immediate naming condition, pictures and distractor words
appeared simultaneously, and participants named the pictures immediately. In the delayed naming condition, the distractors appeared 1,000 ms after the onset of the pictures, and participants
produced the target picture names only when the distractor word
was presented. Within each naming condition, distractor words
were either semantic category coordinates of the target pictures or
unrelated to the target pictures.
We used the presence versus absence of a frequency effect of
the target pictures as an independent means for determining
whether naming latencies in the immediate and delayed naming
conditions reflect the bottleneck at the level of lexical selection. If
participants have already retrieved the lexical representations corresponding to the target picture names in the delayed naming
condition at the time the cue is presented, then there should be no
effect of the frequency of the target pictures on naming latencies.
2
There are several ways in which such a “selection by activation level
model” may be implemented. For instance, we may assume that selection
occurs according to a temporal threshold, an activation threshold, or a
combination of the two. For purposes of the present discussion, it is
sufficient to assume that the word that is ultimately produced in a given
utterance was at the time of selection the most highly activated lexical
node. In other words, either a “temporal threshold” or an “activation
threshold” account (all else equal) would yield the observed semantic
facilitation effects.

BRIEF REPORTS

It is uncontroversial in the field of language production that a
manipulation of frequency affects, at least, lexical levels of processing (Alario, Costa, & Caramazza, 2002; Almeida, Knobel,
Finkbeiner, & Caramazza, in press; Dell, 1990; Jescheniak &
Levelt, 1994; Oldfield & Wingfield, 1965). Previous studies that
have used the delayed naming task have shown that the frequency
effect disappears with delays longer than 800 ms (Jescheniak &
Levelt, 1994; Savage, Bradley, & Forster, 1990; but see Goldinger,
Azuma, Abramson, & Jain, 1997). On the basis of these studies we
expected a frequency effect of the target pictures in the immediate
but not in the delayed naming condition.

Experiment 1: Immediate Versus Delayed Naming
Method
Participants. Sixty-four native English speakers, students at
Harvard University, participated in the experiment. Half participated in the immediate naming condition, half in the delayed
naming condition. All were paid for their participation.
Materials and design. Forty pictures of common objects were
selected from Snodgrass and Vanderwart’s (1980) picture database
and were scaled to fit within a 245-pixels wide ⫻ 240-pixels high
rectangle. Half the pictures had low frequency names (range ⫽ 1–9
per million), and half had high frequency names (range ⫽ 72–724
per million). Properties of the pictures and their names in the low
and high frequency conditions are presented in Table 1. A related
word was selected for each picture, and the unrelated items were
created by re-pairing each word with an unrelated picture from the
other frequency category. Thus, the same words appeared in the
semantically related and unrelated conditions (see Appendix A). In
the design there were two crossed experimental variables (i.e.,
frequency and semantic relatedness) with two levels of each variable. Each cell in the design had 20 items, leading to a total of 80
experimental items. For each experimental item the distractor word
was colored blue. For the filler items the color of the distractor
words was red. Participants’ task in both immediate and delayed
naming conditions alternated unpredictably between picture naming and distractor word reading on the basis of the color of the
distractor word, with blue distractors designating picture naming
and red distractors designating word reading.
A total of 160 items were included in each naming condition
(immediate and delayed). Twelve additional pictures and words

were selected to form 36 practice items. Distractor words were
assigned to pictures and were colored appropriately such that 18
picture naming and 18 word reading items were created.
The experimental and filler items were pseudorandomized into
four blocks of trials. Within a given block there were an equal
number of each condition, and each picture appeared once per
block, either in the experimental or in the filler condition. Care was
taken that (a) on consecutive trials there was no semantic or
phonological relationship between pictures’ names or distractor
words, and (b) no more than three consecutive trials were from the
same condition. The order of the blocks was counterbalanced
according to an orthogonal Latin-square design into four lists.
Procedure. The experiment was controlled by DMDX software (Forster & Forster, 2003). There were three phases in the
experiment. In the first phase, participants were familiarized with
all of the pictures and their names. In this phase, on each trial, a
fixation point appeared for 700 ms and was replaced with the
picture for 2,000 ms. After 1,000 ms, the picture name appeared
beneath the picture and cued the participant to pronounce the
picture name aloud. The second phase consisted of 36 trials in
which the experimental task was practiced. Participants were instructed to name pictures or words depending on the color of the
word. If the word was colored blue they were instructed to name
the picture; whereas if the word was colored red they were to read
the word. The third phase was the experiment proper. The trial
structure of the second and third phases was identical.
Participants either took part in the delayed or in the immediate
naming condition. Participants in the delayed naming condition were
instructed to postpone their naming response until the distractor word
was presented. On each trial in the delayed naming condition, a
fixation point appeared for 700 ms and was replaced by a picture.
After the picture was presented for 1,000 ms, the distractor word
appeared. The pictures and distractor words remained on the screen
for 500 ms. An empty screen was then displayed for 1,000 ms.
Participants in the immediate naming condition were instructed to
name the picture or word upon presentation (depending on the color
of the word). The trial structure for the immediate naming condition
was identical except for the fact that the distractor appeared simultaneously with the presentation of the picture. The picture and distractor
remained on the screen for 500 ms. The participant initiated the next
trial by pressing the space bar. The duration of the experiment was
about 25 min.
Analysis. Only the picture naming trials were analyzed. Three
types of responses were excluded from the analysis of response
times (RTs): (a) naming errors, (b) verbal disfluencies (stuttering,
utterance repairs, production of nonverbal sounds), (c) recording
failures, and (d) RTs below 300 or above 3,000 ms (immediate
naming, 4.7%; delayed naming, 5.3%). RTs exceeding a cutoff
value (defined as a participant’s and an item’s mean plus three
standard deviations) were replaced by the cutoff value (immediate
naming, 2.0%; delayed naming, 4.4%).
In the analyses reported here we distinguish between bysubjects (F1) and by-items (F2) analyses. For the F1 analyses we
treat frequency and semantic relatedness as within-subjects variables. For the F2 analyses we treat frequency as a between-subjects
variable and semantic relatedness as a within-subjects variable. We
report separate analyses for the immediate and delayed naming
conditions. An overview of RTs for each naming condition is
presented in Table 2.

Discussion
In Experiment 1 we tested a central prediction of the response
exclusion hypothesis: If the semantic interference effect arises at a
postlexical level, then a semantic interference effect should be
obtained when participants delay their picture naming responses.
By contrast, if the semantic interference effect reflects lexical
selection by competition, then no semantic interference effect
should be observed under delayed naming conditions. The results
of Experiment 1 demonstrate that semantic interference is observed under delayed naming conditions—that is, in an experimental situation in which a frequency effect of the pictures’ names was
not observed.
Convergent evidence suggesting that semantic interference can
arise under delayed naming conditions has been reported by Hum-

phreys, Lloyd-Jones, and Fias (1995). In that study participants
were shown two colored pictures (e.g., CAR in red, TRUCK in
green) that were then removed from the screen. Participants were
instructed to prepare both picture names for production. After a
delay of 2,000 ms, participants were presented with a cue word
(e.g., the word red). The cue word designated which prepared
response should be produced (i.e., in this case, car). Humphreys et
al. found that picture naming latencies were slower when the two
pictures that had been presented were items from the same semantic category (e.g., CAR and TRUCK) compared to when the two
pictures were items from different semantic categories (e.g., CAR
and TABLE).
One concern with Humphreys et al.’s (1995) findings is that it
cannot be known whether participants in the postcue paradigm
actually prepared their naming responses. For instance, it may
have been the case that in that paradigm participants delayed
lexical processing of the target picture name until presentation of
the cue. In contrast, in Experiment 1, we directly assessed whether
participants prepared their picture-naming responses by manipulating the frequency of the target pictures.
It is important to note that in studies in which the stimuli consist
of pictures of common objects, the lexical frequency variable often
correlates with subjective familiarity and age of acquisition variables (e.g., Barry, Morrison, & Ellis, 1997; Bonin, Barry, Méot, &
Chalard, 2006; Caroll & White, 1973; Ellis & Morrison, 1998;
Gordon, 1983). In our study (both Experiment 1 above and Experiment 2 below) this correlation is also present. Critical for our
purposes, however, is that there is positive empirical evidence
indicating that a manipulation of lexical frequency affects lexicallevel processing, even though the manipulation of lexical frequency is correlated with familiarity and/or age of acquisition.
Almeida et al. (in press) had participants delay their picture naming responses for 1,000 ms. On 75% of trials, participants were
cued to produce the superordinate-level name of pictures, while on
25% of trials, participants were required to produce the basic-level
names. Given this imbalance, participants would be expected to
prepare superordinate-level names more often than basic-level
names. Critically, however, on every trial participants would have
retrieved the concept corresponding to the picture. Thus, under
such circumstances, producing the basic-level name (on 25% of
trials) would reflect only lexical and articulatory processes, not
picture recognition processes. The results revealed a frequency
effect in producing the basic-level names. A control experiment in
which there was no uncertainty regarding the level at which the
pictures were to be named ruled out an articulatory level of
processing for the observed frequency effect. Almeida et al.’s data
thus provide positive evidence for a lexical locus of the frequency
effect in picture naming.
We can thus confidently interpret the lack of a frequency effect
in the delayed naming condition of Experiment 1 as an indication
that participants fully retrieved the lexical nodes corresponding to
the picture names by the time the cue was presented. An interpretation of the data from Experiment 1 in terms of the response
exclusion hypothesis compels an important inference. The fact that
semantic interference can arise despite the fact that the lexical
representation of the target picture has been retrieved means that
the representation corresponding to the distractor (i.e., cue) word
effectively displaces the target response from the single-channel
output buffer. We assume that this happens in situations in which

BRIEF REPORTS

there is a strong difference between the target and distracting
stimuli, in terms of the privileged relationship of those stimuli to
the articulators, and when participants cannot produce the naming
response until distractor (i.e., cue) presentation.
The semantic interference effect in the delayed naming condition in Experiment 1 was marginally significant. Given the importance of this effect for models of lexical selection in speech
production, Experiment 2 is an attempt to further establish the
robustness of this effect.

Participants. Thirty-six native French speakers, students at the
Université de Provence, took part in the experiment. Half participated in the immediate naming condition and half in the delayed
naming condition. All participants received credit for participation.
Materials and design. Twenty-four pictures with high name
agreement (⬎90%) were chosen from the picture set of Alario and
Ferrand (1999). Half of the pictures had a low frequency name, and
half had a high frequency name, as estimated by Lexique (New,
Pallier, Ferrand, & Matos, 2001). Properties of the pictures and their
names in the low and high frequency conditions are presented in
Table 3. Each picture was paired with a semantically related distractor
word to form the semantically related condition, which was then
re-paired with a different picture to form the unrelated condition.
Thus, the same pictures and distractors appeared in the related and
unrelated conditions. This led to a total of 48 experimental items (see
Appendix B) for the immediate and delayed naming conditions. For
each experimental item, the distractor was colored black. For the filler
items, the color of the distractor was dark blue. In total there were 96
items in the experiment. Twenty-four practice pictures were created as
in Experiment 1. Other aspects of the design were identical to those in
Experiment 1.
Procedure. The procedure for the immediate and delayed
naming conditions was identical to that in Experiment 1.
Analysis. The same exclusion criteria as in Experiment 1 were
employed (trials excluded: immediate naming, 9.5%; delayed naming,
6.0%. Trials replaced by cutoff: immediate naming, 0.3%; delayed
naming, 1.5%). One picture (i.e., CYGNE [SWAN]) was discarded
from the analyses due to a high error rate (24%). An overview of RTs
for each naming condition is presented in Table 4.

The results of Experiment 2 establish the reliability of the
findings of Experiment 1 using a new set of materials and a new
language: Semantic interference can be observed in a delayed
naming task in which target naming latencies no longer show a
frequency effect of the target pictures. The presence of a semantic
interference effect in the absence of a target picture frequency
effect indicates that the existence of semantic interference does not
require that target picture naming latencies be determined by the
bottleneck at lexical selection.

General Discussion
We have shown that the semantic interference effect in the
picture–word interference paradigm can arise at a postlexical level
of processing. The presence of the semantic interference effect in

a delayed naming task cannot be explained in terms of lexical
selection by competition. In the introduction, we noted that the
semantic interference effect would constitute empirical support for
the assumption of lexical selection by competition only if there is
reason to believe it is a lexical-level phenomenon. For this reason,
the data that we have reported remove the empirical support from
the picture–word interference paradigm for the hypothesis of lexical selection by competition. By contrast, the presence of the
semantic interference effect in a delayed naming task is a central
prediction of the response exclusion hypothesis (Finkbeiner &
Caramazza, 2006; Mahon et al., 2007).
It might be argued that the demonstration that semantic interference can arise at a postlexical level of processing is consistent
with a two-loci account of the semantic interference effect: one
locus at the lexical level (e.g., La Heij, 1988; Levelt et al., 1999;
Roelofs, 2003) and one locus at the postlexical level. In other
words, the pattern of findings we have reported do not directly
disconfirm the interpretation of the semantic interference effect, as
observed in immediate picture naming, in terms of lexical selection
by competition. Of course, a simpler (i.e., single locus) theory is to
be preferred if there were independent grounds for questioning
whether lexical selection is a competitive process. As noted in the
introduction, a number of studies have demonstrated that higher
levels of activation of nontarget lexical nodes result in faster target
naming latencies (Costa et al., 2005; Finkbeiner & Caramazza,
2006; Mahon et al., 2007; Miozzo & Caramazza, 2003). Such
findings (for review, see Mahon et al., 2007) provide independent
evidence for challenging the assumption that lexical selection is by
competition. We thus favor the view that the semantic interference
effect in the picture–word interference paradigm arises at a
postlexical level of processing. An important topic for future
research is whether other observations of semantic interference
(e.g., Howard, Nickels, Coltheart, & Cole-Virtue, 2006) fall within
the scope of the response exclusion hypothesis.
