Episodic Simulation of Future
Events

ABSTRACT—Episodic

memory enables individuals to recollect past events as well as imagine possible future scenarios. Although the episodic specificity of past events declines
as people grow older, it is unknown whether the same is
true for future events. In an adapted version of the Autobiographical Interview, young and older participants
generated past and future events. Transcriptions were
segmented into distinct details that were classified as either
internal (episodic) or external. Older adults generated
fewer internal details than younger adults for past events,
a result replicating previous findings; more important, we
show that this deficit extends to future events. Furthermore, the number of internal details and the number of
external details both showed correlations between past and
future events. Finally, the number of internal details generated by older adults correlated with their relational
memory abilities, a finding consistent with the constructiveepisodic-simulation hypothesis, which holds that simulation of future episodes requires a system that can flexibly
recombine details from past events into novel scenarios.
Considerable research has documented age-related changes in
the functioning of episodic memory (Craik & Salthouse, 2000).
As has been the case with most theoretical and empirical work
on episodic memory, research on aging memory has traditionally
focused on the recollection of past events. However, episodic
memory allows individuals to project themselves both backward
and forward in subjective time; representations of both past and
future events can contain rich contextual details about events
specific in time and place (Tulving, 1983). Recently, there has
been growing interest in the role of episodic memory in simu-

lating or imagining future episodes and scenarios (for recent
reviews, see Buckner & Carroll, 2007; Schacter & Addis, 2007a;
Schacter, Addis, & Buckner, 2007). The main purpose of the
present study was to compare younger and older adults’ ability to
simulate future personal events and past personal events.
The conceptual framework for our study is provided by the
constructive-episodic-simulation hypothesis (Schacter & Addis,
2007a, 2007b; see also Suddendorf & Corballis, 1997), which
holds that simulation of future episodes requires a system that
can flexibly recombine details from past events. According to
this view, (a) past and future events draw on similar information
stored in episodic memory and rely on similar cognitive processes during construction (e.g., self-referential processing and
imagery), and (b) episodic memory supports the construction of
future events by extracting and recombining stored information
into a simulation of an event that never occurred previously in
that exact form. We consider evidence supporting the constructive-episodic-simulation hypothesis and then spell out the
implications for aging memory.
Converging lines of evidence have demonstrated considerable
overlap in the cognitive properties and neural substrates of past
and future events (Buckner & Carroll, 2007; Schacter & Addis,
2007a). It has been shown that although representations of past
events are associated with more perceptual detail than are
representations of future events, factors influencing the phenomenology of past events influence the phenomenology of future events in the same way. For instance, D’Argembeau and
van der Linden (2004) and Szpunar and McDermott (in press)
demonstrated that temporally close events in either the past or
the future had more detailed representations than temporally
distant events. Moreover, Szpunar and McDermott found that
increased familiarity of the event context increased the amount
of detail in representations of past and future events. It has also
been shown that individual differences in imagery ability and
emotion regulation influence the qualities of representations of
past and future events (D’Argembeau & van der Linden, 2006).

Age-Related Changes in Simulation of Future Events

Recent neuroimaging studies have indicated that a common
neural network is engaged when people remember past events
and when they imagine future events (Addis, Wong, & Schacter,
2007; Okuda et al., 2003; Szpunar, Watson, & McDermott,
2007). For example, we (Addis et al., 2007) examined the neural
correlates of past and future events during (a) an initial construction phase in which participants generated a past or future
event in response to a cue (e.g., ‘‘dress’’) and (b) an elaboration
phase in which participants generated as much detail as possible about the event. Despite some neural differences during
the construction phase, there was neural overlap between the
past and future tasks; neural overlap was even more apparent
during the elaboration phase. Results were consistent with the
constructive-episodic-simulation hypothesis in that this common past-future network of medial prefrontal, temporopolar,
hippocampal-parahippocampal, and medial and lateral parietal
regions was remarkably similar to the network consistently engaged by retrieval of past autobiographical events (Maguire,
2001).
This finding of common neural activity associated with past
and future events is consistent with the case reports of two
amnesic patients: K.C., who developed severe amnesia after a
head injury that damaged the medial temporal and frontal lobes
(Rosenbaum et al., 2005; Tulving, 1985), and D.B., who developed memory problems after cardiac arrest (Klein, Loftus, &
Kihlstrom, 2002). Both of these patients were reported to have
difficulty envisaging future personal events. A more recent study
showed that 4 of 5 amnesic patients with bilateral hippocampal
damage had difficulties imagining new experiences, and in particular, had difficulty forming coherent imagined events (Hassabis, Kumaran, Vann, & Maguire, 2007). Finally, Williams et al.
(1996) demonstrated reduced specificity of representations of
both past and future events in suicidally depressed patients.
Taken together, these lines of evidence support the constructive-episodic-simulation hypothesis and provide a basis for
generating hypotheses concerning simulation of future events as
people grow older. Healthy older adults exhibit a number of
deficits in episodic memory, but two are especially relevant to
the simulation of future events and to the constructive-episodic-

simulation hypothesis. First, older adults sometimes have
difficulties with relational processes that link together elements
of an episode (e.g., Chalfonte & Johnson, 1996; Lyle, Bloise, &
Johnson, 2006). As noted earlier, the constructive-episodicsimulation hypothesis holds that construction of future events
relies on recombining elements of past episodes, which draws on
relational processes. Second, previous work has shown that
aging is associated with reductions in the episodic specificity of
past events. Levine, Svoboda, Hay, Winocur, and Moscovitch
(2002) examined age-related changes in the episodic quality of
past events using the Autobiographical Interview (AI), a measure that distinguishes episodic information from other, ‘‘external’’ details (e.g., semantic information, other external events,
repetitions) in a participant’s description of a past event. This
analysis revealed that older adults recalled significantly fewer
episodic details and tended to produce more external information than younger adults did.
Given these findings of age-related reductions in episodic
specificity of past events and age-related impairment in relational processing, which is likely relevant to construction of
future events, we hypothesized that older adults would exhibit
reduced episodic specificity in their simulations of future
events, compared with young adults. We also hypothesized that
such a deficit would be correlated with performance on a
memory task sensitive to relational processing.

METHOD

Participants
Seventeen young and 17 older adults with no history of neurological or psychiatric impairment gave informed written consent
in a manner approved by the Harvard Institutional Review
Board. Data from 1 young adult and 1 older adult were excluded
because of technical difficulties; thus, data from 16 young and
16 older adults are presented. In a session separate from that
described next, all older adults completed a neuropsychological
battery (see Table 1 for a summary of the results of this testing, as
well as the two groups’ demographics).

Adapted AI
Participants completed an adapted version of the AI that probed
events from both the past and the future. In each of four conditions (past few weeks, past few years, next few weeks, and next
few years), participants generated eight events in response to
randomly presented cue words (Crovitz & Schiffman, 1974).
Although studies with young adults have sampled events further
into the past or future (e.g., 20 years in Addis et al., 2007), the
advanced age of the older adults meant that this was not feasible
in the current study. Both time periods (weeks and years) for one
temporal direction (past or future) were completed before the
conditions in the other temporal direction began. Conditions
were blocked in this manner to reduce load and facilitate older
adults’ understanding of the instructions for each condition.
Order of presentation of temporal direction and time periods was
counterbalanced.
Stimuli
The cues were 32 nouns taken from Clark and Paivio’s (2004)
extended norms. All cues were high in Thorndike-Lorge frequency (M 5 1.72, SD 5 0.26), imageability (M 5 5.92, SD 5
0.35), and concreteness (M 5 6.83, SD 5 0.29). They were
divided into four lists of eight nouns matched for these variables.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirmed that the lists did not
differ significantly in frequency, F(3, 28) 5 0.02, prep 5 .03,
Z2 5 .002; imageability, F(3, 28) 5 0.06, prep 5 .07, Z2 5 .006;
or concreteness, F(3, 28) 5 1.80, prep 5 .75, Z2 5 .16. Lists of
cue words cycled through conditions in a fully counterbalanced
design. Each participant was randomly assigned to a counterbalanced version.
Interview
On each trial, participants were instructed to recall or imagine
an event and to generate as much detail about that event as
possible within a 3-min time limit. The event generated in response to a cue word did not have to strictly involve the named
object; participants were encouraged to freely associate so that
they would be successful in generating an event. Each event was
required, however, to be temporally and contextually specific
(i.e., episodic), occurring over minutes or hours, but not more
than 1 day. Future events had to be plausible, given the participant’s plans, and novel, that is, not previously experienced
by the participant. Participants were asked to try to experience
events from a field perspective (i.e., from the perspective of
being there) rather than an observer perspective (i.e., from an
external vantage point in which they observed themselves).
For the duration of each trial, the relevant cue word was
displayed on a computer screen along with the task instruction
(‘‘recall past event’’ or ‘‘imagine future event’’) and time period.
When necessary, general probes were given to clarify instructions and encourage further description of details. After 3 min, a
bell sounded to indicate the end of the trial. The participant then

Volume 19—Number 1

dated the event and rated it on 5-point scales for level of detail
(1 5 vague with no/few details, 5 5 vivid; for brevity, results for
this variable are not discussed, given that more extensive
measures of detail were obtained using the AI), emotionality
(i.e., intensity of emotion experienced upon recalling or imagining the event; 1 5 nonemotional, 5 5 highly emotional), and
personal significance (i.e., how life-changing the event was or
would be; 1 5 insignificant, 5 5 life-changing). The interview
took approximately 2.5 hr. Participants were tested individually,
and responses were recorded using a digital audio recorder so
that they could be transcribed later.

Scoring
The standardized AI scoring procedure (Levine et al., 2002) was
used. For each participant, events generated in response to the
first four randomly presented cue words in each condition were
scored by one of three scorers. First, the central event was
identified; if more than one event was mentioned, the event that
was discussed in most detail and that occurred over a brief time
frame was selected as the central event. The transcription was
then segmented into distinct details, or chunks of information
(e.g., a unique occurrence or thought), and these details were
categorized as internal (episodic information relating to the
central event) or external (nonepisodic information, including
semantic details and information concerning extended events
that are not specific in time and place, and repetitions). For each
event, the numbers of internal and external details were tallied,
and the totals were then averaged across the four events in each
condition to create internal and external AI scores for each
condition for each participant. Interrater reliability of scoring,
established on the basis of 20 events scored by all three raters
and an intraclass correlation analysis, was high (two-way mixed
model; standardized Cronbach’s a 5 .96 for internal AI scores
and .92 for external AI scores). Note that all scorers were blind to
group membership, but given that event content could imply
group membership, we ensured that the principal scorer (who
scored 288 of the 512 event transcripts) was blind to the hypotheses of this study.
RESULTS

Phenomenology of Past and Future Events
Table 2 summarizes the phenomenological qualities of the past
and future events generated by participants. To ensure that
temporal distance of events did not differ significantly between
groups or temporal directions (past vs. future), we analyzed the
dates of the events (converted to weeks from the present) using a
series of repeated measures ANOVAs with the within-groups
factors of time period (weeks vs. years) and temporal direction
(past vs. future) and the between-groups factor of age group
(young vs. old). Recency did not differ between age groups, F(1,
30) 5 0.14, prep 5 .35, Z2 < .01. Thus, any group differences in

the AI scores cannot be accounted for by recency. This analysis
did reveal, however, a main effect of time period, F(1, 30) 5
231.72, prep > .99, Z2 5 .89, confirming that events in the year
conditions (past few years, next few years) were significantly
more distant than events in the week conditions (past few weeks,
next few weeks). There was also a significant effect of temporal
direction, F(1, 30) 5 10.23, prep 5 .97, Z2 5 .25, with past
events being more distant than future events, and a significant
interaction of time period and temporal distance, F(1, 30) 5
11.17, prep 5 .98, Z2 5 .27, indicating that within the week
condition, past events were closer to the present than future
events, whereas within the year condition, past events were
further from the present than future events. Also, older adults
generated more distant past events and closer future events than
younger adults, F(1, 30) 5 4.68, prep 5 .89, Z2 5 .14.
We also wanted to examine whether the phenomenological
qualities of events differed across age groups, temporal directions, or time periods, given that such differences could change
interpretations of other effects. Mann-Whitney U tests revealed
that older adults produced more emotional events than younger
adults (U 5 73.00, prep 5 .89). In contrast, there were no group
differences in ratings of personal significance (U 5 87.00, prep 5
.80). Wilcoxon sign tests showed that the emotional intensity of
events did not differ with temporal direction (Z 5 1.51, prep 5
.79) or time period (Z 5 0.19, prep 5 .23). Ratings for personal
significance were higher for future than for past events (Z 5
2.79, prep 5 .97) and were also higher for temporally distant
than for close events (Z 5 2.79, prep 5 .97).

Adapted AI
We conducted two repeated measures ANOVAs, one each for the
internal and external AI scores. Each ANOVA had two withinsubjects factors (temporal direction: past vs. future; time period:
weeks vs. years) and one between-subjects factor (group: young
vs. old). Of most interest here, we found significant group
differences, with older adults producing fewer internal details,

36

F(1, 30) 5 14.49, prep 5 .99, Z2 5 .326, but more external
details, F(1, 30) 5 6.54, prep > .94, Z2 5 .179, than young
adults (see Fig. 1a). These group effects were remarkably similar
for both temporal directions and both time periods (i.e., there
were no interactions; see Fig. 1d). The analyses also revealed
differences between past and future events, with past events
containing more internal details than future events, F(1, 30) 5
25.21, prep > .99, Z2 5 .457 (see Fig. 1b). Additionally, temporally close events contained more internal details than distant
events, F(1, 30) 5 4.12, prep 5 .88, Z2 5 .121 (see Fig. 1c). No
such effects were evident for external details.
Combining the data for the two age groups, we found that past
and future internal AI scores were significantly correlated (r 5
.82, prep > .99), as were past and future external AI scores (r 5
.65, prep > .99; see Fig. 2). In contrast, past internal and external
AI scores were uncorrelated (r 5 .001, prep 5 .50), as were
future internal and external AI scores (r 5 .07, prep 5 .61).
For older adults, we also computed correlations between AI
scores and neuropsychological measures. To measure relational
episodic memory, we used the Recall Total Score from the Verbal
Paired Associates I (VPA) subscale of the Wechsler Memory
Scale–Third Edition; studies have demonstrated that this score
is sensitive to medial temporal function (Glisky, Polster, &
Routhieaux, 1995; Lezak, 1995). To measure executive functioning, we used the Digit Span Backwards subscale from the
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Third Edition, the number of
categories achieved on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST;
i.e., the number of card-sorting rules, out of six, that the participant applies correctly on 10 successive trials), and phonemic
fluency (i.e., the number of words generated in response to the
letters F, A, and S; Glisky et al., 1995; Lezak, 1995). VPA performance was significantly and positively correlated with the
number of internal details in the descriptions of past (r 5 .43,
prep 5 .88) and future (r 5 .55, prep 5 .94) events (see Fig. 3).
External AI scores, however, did not correlate with relational
memory (past events: r 5 .23, prep 5 .73; future events: r 5
.01, prep 5 .51; see Fig. 3). Digit Span Backwards scores

correlated with internal AI scores, and this relationship was
significant for future events (past events: r 5 .41, prep 5 .86;
future events: r 5 .47, prep 5 .90). There were no correlations
between this measure and external AI scores (past events: r 5
.09, prep 5 .60; future events: r 5 .06, prep 5 .56). Moreover, the
other two measures of executive functioning showed no correlations with either internal or external AI scores. For phonemic
fluency, correlational analysis yielded r values of .07 (prep 5
.57) for past internal details, .13 (prep 5 .63) for past external
details, .04 (prep 5 .54) for future internal details, and .20
(prep 5 .70) for future external details. The corresponding values
for the WCST were .08 (prep 5 .58), .22 (prep 5 .72), .002
(prep 5 .50), and .08 (prep 5 .59). Note that the lack of correlations with WCST scores may reflect the restricted variance of
these scores.
DISCUSSION

Our data show that the age-related reduction in the episodic
specificity of past events (Levine et al., 2002) extends to future
events, a finding consistent with recent findings of similar
temporal distributions for past and future events generated by
older adults (Spreng & Levine, 2006). Compared with young

Volume 19—Number 1

adults, older adults generated significantly fewer internal, episodic details, and more external details, when remembering past
events or imagining future events. It seems unlikely that the
group difference in the emotional intensity of events (i.e., greater
emotional intensity for events generated by older adults than for
events generated by young adults) can account for the age-related reduction in specificity, as these two effects were in opposite directions.
The striking similarity between the episodic specificity of past
and future events was also reflected in the strong correlations
between the past and future internal (.82) and external (.65) AI
scores. These correlations are similar to, but stronger than, the
correlations Williams et al. (1996) reported for depressed patients (r 5 .57), and they likely reflect the sensitivity of the AI to
the specificity of autobiographical events. Notably, only the
correlations between past and future events were significant;
correlations between past internal and external scores and between future internal and external scores were negligible.
Our data provide further support for the constructive-episodic-simulation hypothesis. Not only do the common age-related deficits for past and future internal details support the
hypothesis, but so too does the positive correlation between
degree of impairment and performance on VPA, an episodic-

memory measure that probes the ability to integrate information
and form relations between items (i.e., relational memory).
Paradigms using paired associates (e.g., pairs of words or objects) are known to engage the hippocampus (Giovanello,
Schnyer, & Verfaellie, 2004) and are sensitive to medial temporal function (Glisky et al., 1995). The association of episodic
specificity of past and future events with this measure of relational memory is consistent with reports that patients with medial temporal damage experience difficulty imagining future
events (Hassabis et al., 2007; Rosenbaum et al., 2005; Tulving,
1985). Furthermore, the correlation between VPA performance
and the specificity of remembered past events dovetails with the
idea that the retrieval of past autobiographical events requires

38

reintegration of various episodic details (Moscovitch et al.,
2005).
Given that age-related deficits in episodic memory are pronounced for relational-memory tasks (Chalfonte & Johnson,
1996; Lyle et al., 2006; Spencer & Raz, 1995), it is not entirely
surprising that the episodic specificity of past events was also
reduced in older adults. Moreover, the strong correlation between VPA performance and the episodic specificity of future
events suggests that imagining detailed future events also relies
on relational memory and the ability to recombine and integrate
details from various episodic memories. Indeed, Hassabis et al.
(2007) noted that even if hippocampal amnesic patients could
imagine some details about a future experience, their imagin-

ings lacked overall coherence. Additionally, we (Addis et al.,
2007) found not only that the construction of past and future
events engaged the left hippocampus, but also that construction
of future events recruited the right hippocampus as well. We
suggested that this recruitment of additional hippocampal resources may reflect the increased relational processing required
when recombining disparate details into a unique coherent
event. Further research is needed, however, to examine whether
the generation of past and future episodic details is associated
specifically with relational episodic memory, or whether it also
correlates with other measures probing different types of
memory, including semantic memory.
The specificity of these findings to memory functions also
remains to be determined. Do cognitive abilities aside from

Volume 19—Number 1

memory, such as executive functions, contribute to the generation of past and future episodic details? There was evidence that
the episodic specificity of past and future events correlates with
one measure of executive functioning, Digit Span Backwards.
This observation suggests that executive functioning plays a role
in event-generation tasks, as well as in digit-span tasks, which
would not be entirely surprising, given that both tasks should
engage attention and that executive functions are known to be
involved in the retrieval (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce, 2000;
Moscovitch, 1992) and specificity (Dalgleish et al., 2007) of past
events. Although other studies have found specificity of future
events and executive measures tapping verbal generation (e.g.,
phonemic fluency) to be uncorrelated (Williams et al., 1996), as
reported here, neuroimaging studies suggest that the left pre-

39

Age-Related Changes in Simulation of Future Events

frontal cortex plays a role in both generative processing and
construction of future events (Addis et al., 2007). Future research is required to better characterize the nature of prefrontal
contributions to the generation of past and future events.
The preserved ability of older adults to generate external
details suggests that the age-related reduction in internal details
does not simply reflect a general reduction in verbal output. This
observation is further supported by the lack of correlation between AI scores and phonemic fluency. It is possible that
differences in the narrative styles of young and older adults
influenced the types of details generated and the apparent
difference in the episodic specificity of events. For instance,
older adults may have provided more external details as a result
of their breadth of knowledge and wisdom (Labouvie-Vief &
Blanchard-Fields, 1982) and as a means of placing events
within broader and more meaningful contexts (Levine et al.,
2002), whereas young adults may have adhered to the instructions to focus on a specific event. If older adults spent more of
their 3-min retrieval time providing external information, their
time spent producing internal details may have been minimized.
If this were the case, one would expect the internal and external
AI scores to have been negatively correlated. However, these
correlations were negligible, which suggests that the generation
of internal details was unrelated to the generation of external
details and that the age-related reduction in internal details was
not simply a function of focusing on external information.
Rather, it was likely due to some other mechanism, and the
constructive-episodic-simulation hypothesis suggests that the
most likely candidate is relational episodic-memory function.
This study also provided an opportunity to examine the ways
in which past and future events differ, for instance, with respect
to phenomenological qualities. Representations of past and future events should differ in some respects, given previous evidence showing differences between remembered and imagined
events. Thus, one would expect past and future events to differ at
least in the amount of detail produced, as suggested by the reality-monitoring framework, which posits that real events contain more detail than imagined events (Johnson, Foley, Suengas,
& Raye, 1988). Indeed, our study replicated previous work by
D’Argembeau and van der Linden (2004) in that we found past
events contained, on average, more details than future events.
We also replicated D’Argembeau and van der Linden’s finding
that personal significance is greater for future than for past
events, a pattern likely reflecting the fact that future events can
be relevant to one’s current goal states in a way that past events,
by definition, are not.
Temporal distance also influenced event phenomenology.
Events weeks into the past or future contained significantly more
internal details than temporally distant events, a finding that is
consistent with previous results (D’Argembeau & van der Linden, 2004; Szpunar & McDermott, in press) and that provides
some support for the idea that temporally close events are represented more concretely (cf. temporal construal theory; Trope &

40

Liberman, 2003). Temporally distant events tended to be rated
as more personally significant than close events, possibly because one can focus on insignificant, everyday events within
temporally close time frames, but only more important events
stand out when one is projecting further out in time. However,
although D’Argembeau and van der Linden (2004) found this
same pattern for future events, they found the opposite effect for
past events (i.e., close events were more personally significant
than distant events).
In summary, this study demonstrates that the age-related reduction of episodic specificity evident for past events extends to
future events, a finding consistent with data from patients suggesting that deficits in memory can be associated with difficulties in imagining future experiences. Both the number of
internal details and the number of external details showed strong
positive correlations between past and future events—further
evidence of the close linkage of mental representations of past
and future events. Finally, in older adults, the integrity of relational memory was positively correlated with the ability to
generate internal, but not external, details for both past and
future events. This finding is consistent with data from hippocampal amnesic patients and with neuroimaging data implicating the hippocampus in the generation of both past and future
events. Moreover, this finding is consistent with the constructive-episodic-simulation hypothesis (Schacter & Addis, 2007a,
2007b), suggesting that relational memory is an important
component process of both remembering the past and imagining
the future, likely supporting the reintegration of details for remembering past events and the recombination of details for
imagining novel future events.
