Precision of the Anchor
Influences the Amount of
Adjustment

ABSTRACT—The

anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic has
been used to account for a wide variety of numerical
judgments. Five studies show that adjustment away from a
numerical anchor is smaller if the anchor is precise than if
it is rounded. Evidence suggests that precise anchors,
compared with rounded anchors, are represented on a
subjective scale with a finer resolution. If adjustment
consists of a series of iterative mental movements along a
subjective scale, then an adjustment from a precise anchor
should result in a smaller overall correction than an adjustment from a rounded anchor.

The anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic (Tversky & Kahneman,
1974) has been used to account for a wide variety of numerical
judgments, including appraisals of home values (Northcraft &
Neale, 1987), estimates of risk and uncertainty (Wright & Anderson, 1989), and estimates of future performance (Switzer &
Sniezek, 1991). In all these cases, the explanation rests on the
claim that a numerical judgment can be influenced by the prior
consideration of a numerical anchor (i.e., referent). For example,
Northcraft and Neale (1987) asked real estate agents to estimate
the appraised value of a home. Agents who received an information packet that included a higher list price estimated a
higher appraisal value. Northcraft and Neale proposed that the
agents started the judgment process by rejecting the list price as
an accurate estimate and then adjusted downward until they
reached a plausible estimate. Adjustments tend to be insufficient, so the final appraisal values were biased in the direction of
the initial anchor value.

Two fundamental questions concerning numerical judgments
are, when do people adjust, and what factors influence the
amount of adjustment? With respect to the first question, recent
evidence suggests that when people perceive that an anchor is
diagnostic but incorrect, they often attempt to adjust from that
anchor when formulating their estimate (Epley & Gilovich,
2001, 2005, 2006). For example, consider how people might
respond if asked, ‘‘Is the freezing point of vodka 32 1F?’’ and
then ‘‘What is the freezing point of vodka?’’ Although they know
that the freezing point of vodka is not 32 1F, many people perceive that this anchor is diagnostic because it is the freezing
point of water. Hence, a downward adjustment from this anchor
is a legitimate strategy for making an educated guess at the
answer to the second question.
With respect to the second question, there are many factors
that influence the amount of adjustment from a diagnostic
anchor. These factors include the perceived relevance of the
anchor to the judgment (Mussweiler & Strack, 1999), beliefs
about the degree of error of the anchor (Gilbert, 2002; Wegener
& Petty, 1995), and the ambiguity and uncertainty associated
with the anchor (Einhorn & Hogarth, 1985). The common theme
underlying all of these influences is that reduced confidence
in the accuracy of a diagnostic anchor will lead to a greater
amount of adjustment. We believe that there is an additional,
arguably more fundamental, factor that influences the amount
of adjustment from a plausible anchor. If adjustment is viewed
as movement along a subjective representational scale, then
the resolution of this scale might also influence the amount
of adjustment. X units of adjustment along a fine-resolution
scale will cover less objective distance than the same number
of units of adjustment along a coarse-resolution scale. As a
consequence, there will be less adjustment when numerical
judgments are made using subjective scales with a finer
resolution.

Anchor Precision Influences the Amount of Adjustment

EXPERIMENT 1

Experiment 1 assessed the influence of rounded versus precise
anchors on the amount of adjustment from the anchor. The
precise anchors came in two forms. Precise under anchors were
values up to 3% below the rounded anchors. Precise over anchors
were values up to 3% above the rounded anchors. Table 1 lists
the values of the rounded, precise under, and precise over anchors for the 10 scenarios used in this experiment.
Method
Forty-three students from an undergraduate subject pool participated in the experiment for extra credit. The experiment used
a mixed design with type of anchor (rounded, precise under,
precise over) as a between-subjects factor and scenario (10—
see Table 1) as a within-subjects factor. Respondents read the
scenarios one at a time and provided a numerical estimate for
each scenario before moving on to the next.
Nine of the scenarios investigated price estimates (plasma TV,
quick-melt cheese, beach house, pet rock, figurine) or estimates
of attribute values (grams of protein in a health drink, pen life in
kilometers, basketball shooting percentage, Hummer height).
For example, the plasma-TV scenario stated:
Imagine that you have just earned your first paycheck as a highly
paid executive. As a result, you want to reward yourself by buying
a large-screen, high-definition plasma TV. As you browse through
a store, you see a plasma TV from Sony that you like because of its
attractive carbon-fiber finish. Its WEGA 50-inch screen has been
rated by a panel of electronics experts as the ‘‘clearest and
sharpest in the market today, because of a new technology that
doubled its resolution and increased its contrast ratio to 4,000:1.’’

If you were to guess the plasma TV’s actual cost to the retailer (i.e.,
how much the store bought it for), what would it be? Because this is
your first purchase of a plasma TV, you have very little information
with which to base your estimate. All you know is that it should
cost less than the retail price of $5,000/$4,988/$5,012. Guess the
product’s actual cost. This electronics store is known to offer a fair
price. Most of their items are priced very close to their actual cost
because they compete on volume. The only reason that this particular plasma TV is expensive is that it uses a new technology, and
the picture quality is outstanding. So the actual cost would be only
slightly less than $5,000/$4,988/$5,012.

A context-free scenario (i.e., ‘‘There is a number saved in a
file on this computer. It is just slightly less than 10,000/9,989/
10,011. Can you guess the number?’’) was also included. We
assumed this scenario was free of preexisting associations and
that estimates would not be affected by inferences about the
reliability of the anchor.

Results
Main Analysis
The raw cell means are reported in Table 1. The difference
between the anchor value and each estimate was calculated and
transformed into a z score using the error term from the entire
sample. The Type of Anchor ! Scenario interaction was not
significant, F(18, 360) 5 0.52, so we collapsed the data across
the 10 scenarios and found that the type of anchor had a significant effect, F(2, 40) 5 10.94, o2 5 .32. The rounded anchors
(M 5 0.35, MSE 5 0.1) resulted in an adjustment that was larger
than the average adjustment observed with the precise anchors
(under: M 5 "0.21, MSE 5 0.08; over: M 5 "0.16, MSE 5

0.1), F(1, 40) 5 21.78, prep 5 .996, o2 5 .33. The estimates did
not differ between the precise under and precise over anchors,
F(1, 40) 5 0.10.
Supplemental Analysis
If different types of anchors induce people to represent their
subjective scale differently, then rounded anchors should encourage rounded responses, and precise anchors should encourage precise responses. To test this idea, we coded each
response for its level of precision. For example, in the beachhouse scenario, an estimate that was a multiple of $5,000,
$10,000, or $25,000 was considered rounded. The rounded
anchors resulted in a larger proportion of rounded responses
(.73) than the precise under anchors (.49) and the precise over
anchors (.46), F(1, 40) 5 15.01, prep 5 .996.
Discussion
Experiment 1 shows that precise and rounded anchors result in
estimates that are, respectively, closer to and farther from the
anchor value. We propose that the precision of an anchor value
can influence the resolution of the subjective scale used to
represent the to-be-judged dimension. If respondents make an
estimate by adjusting by X units on a subjective scale, they will
cover less distance on a fine-resolution scale than on a coarseresolution scale.
The results of Experiment 1 can be used to rule out two
alternative hypotheses. First, it does not appear that the estimation process is based on the selective accessibility of information that results from considering the anchor value. The
rounded and precise anchors were similar in value, and therefore should have encouraged the consideration of similar information. Second, it does not appear that respondents took a
proportion of the anchor value to calculate their estimated value.
If respondents were using a proportion rule, then the estimates
associated with the rounded anchors should have been between
the estimates associated with the precise under and precise over
anchors.
EXPERIMENT 2

A plausible alternative explanation for the results of Experiment 1 is that they were due to a difference in objective scale
ranges. That is, a precise anchor might evoke a narrower range
of plausible responses than a rounded anchor. If the adjustment from the anchor value is a constant percentage change
within the objective range of plausible responses, then the
narrower range in the precise-anchor condition would result in
less adjustment than observed in the rounded-anchor condition.
In Experiment 2, we manipulated the objective scale range
independently of anchor precision. For example, the following
information was added to the plasma-TV scenario in the broadrange condition (note that precise over anchors were not in-

Volume 19—Number 2

cluded in this experiment): ‘‘You also know that electronics
stores can make margins as high as 40%, suggesting that the cost
could be as low as $3,000/$2,998, although these types of
margins are usually for peripherals like headphones and/or iPod
holders.’’ In the narrow-range condition, a 20% margin was
suggested in this scenario, and the possible actual cost was
given as $4,000 or $3,998. If anchor precision influences the
resolution of the respondent’s subjective scale, then the effect
of anchor precision on estimates would be independent of the
effect of scale range. If anchor precision influences the range of
plausible objective values and not scale resolution, then the
effect of anchor precision either would be overwhelmed by the
manipulation of scale range or would correlate with the observed
effect of range.
Method
Eighty-five students from an undergraduate subject pool participated in this experiment for extra credit. The experiment
used a mixed design with type of anchor (rounded, precise under) and range of plausible values (narrow, broad) as betweensubjects factors and scenario (plasma TV, pet rock, beach house,
Hummer, figurine) as a within-subjects factor.1 The procedure
mimicked that of Experiment 1 except for the addition of a
manipulation check. After responding to all five scenarios, respondents reconsidered each scenario and provided a range of
plausible estimates.
To ensure that we would obtain a range effect, we set the lower
values in the broad range to correspond to the lowest estimates
reported in Experiment 1. The lower values in the narrow range
were set to correspond to the median estimates in Experiment 1
(see Table 2). For both broad and narrow ranges, the lower values
were precise when the anchor was precise.
Results
Manipulation Check
The plausible range values given by the participants were
transformed into z scores. As expected, the range manipulation
influenced the lowest plausible value. The lowest plausible
value was lower in the broad-range condition (M 5 "0.47, MSE 5
0.1) than in the narrow-range condition (M 5 0.48, MSE 5 0.05),
F(1, 81) 5 66.65, prep 5 .996, o2 5 .43. There was no influence of
the type of anchor on the lowest plausible value, F(1, 81) 5 0.15,
nor was there an interaction of range and type of anchor, F(1, 81)
5 0.11. As expected, the manipulations had no influence on the
highest plausible value.
Estimates
As in Experiment 1, the difference between the anchor value
and each estimate was calculated and transformed into a z score.

The remaining scenarios could not be modified to be consistent with the
range manipulation.

F(1, 81) 5 0.01.

EXPERIMENT 3

Experiment 2 provides evidence that anchor precision has an
influence on adjustment that is independent of the influence of
the objective range of plausible values. Experiment 3 addressed
the possibility that precise anchors led to smaller adjustments
because respondents perceived them as more accurate or valid
(i.e., reliable) than rounded anchors. To test this hypothesis, we
added a reliable-rounded-anchor condition to the precise- and
rounded-anchor conditions. In the reliable-rounded-anchor
condition, information was added to the rounded-anchor materials to make participants more confident in the anchor. For
example, the plasma-TV scenario was modified by adding,

All you know are the following three things. First, the plasma TV
should cost less than the retail price of $5,000. Second, you have
checked the price of the plasma TVat three other stores in the area.
They were all selling the plasma TV for $5,000. Third, you
checked on-line and the lowest price you saw was $5,000.

Similar modifications were made to the four other scenarios
presented to participants (beach house, figurine, Hummer, pet
rock).
We expected that making an anchor more reliable would lead
to less adjustment. We also expected that the effect of the reliability manipulation would be independent of the effect of anchor precision. If a reliable rounded anchor is perceived as more
reliable than a precise anchor, but a precise anchor results in
less adjustment than a reliable rounded anchor, then the reliability of the anchor cannot be responsible for the anchorprecision effect.

124

Method
Forty-five students from an undergraduate subject pool participated in the experiment for extra credit. The experiment used a
mixed design with type of anchor (rounded, reliable rounded, precise under) as a between-subjects factor and scenario
(plasma TV, pet rock, beach house, Hummer, figurine) as a
within-subjects factor. The stimulus materials were identical to
those used in Experiment 2 except for the additional information
for the reliable rounded anchors. The procedure included
checks on the manipulation of reliability. After responding to all
five scenarios, respondents were asked to reconsider each scenario and indicate the reliability of the anchor. They used three
7-point scales to indicate how informative they found the anchor
(not informative, very informative), how much they relied on it
when making the estimate (not at all, considerably), and how
confident they were that the anchor was a good starting point for
the estimate (not confident, very confident). Finally, participants
were asked how much they tried to adjust from the anchor.
Results
Manipulation Check
The three measures of anchor reliability were averaged to create
a reliability index for each scenario (average Cronbach’s a 5
.86). The indices for the five scenarios were analyzed using a
repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance. An initial
analysis confirmed the effectiveness of the reliability manipulation, F(2, 42) 5 37.02, o2 5 .30. Planned contrasts showed
that the reliable rounded anchors (M 5 5.90, MSE 5 0.15) were
perceived as more reliable than the precise anchors (M 5 4.11,
MSE 5 0.18), F(1, 42) 5 59.03, prep 5 .996, o2 5 .50, but that
the rounded anchors (M 5 4.28, MSE 5 0.17) and precise anchors (M 5 4.11, MSE 5 0.18) were perceived as equally reliable, F(1, 42) 5 0.55. The degree to which participants
perceived that they were trying to adjust from the anchor did not
vary by condition, F(2, 42) 5 0.15.
Estimates
An initial analysis confirmed the influence of the anchor manipulation, F(2, 42) 5 23.07, o2 5 .24. The results of Experiment 1 were replicated: A planned contrast showed that the

Volume 19—Number 2

Chris Janiszewski and Dan Uy

rounded anchors (M 5 0.49, MSE 5 0.13) led to more adjustment than the precise anchors (M 5 "0.66, MSE 5 0.11), F(1,
42) 5 44.61, prep 5 .996, o2 5 .49. Another planned contrast
showed that the reliable rounded anchors (M 5 0.12, MSE 5
0.11) led to more adjustment than the precise anchors (M 5
"0.66, MSE 5 0.11), F(1, 42) 5 20.80, prep 5 .996, o2 5 .22.
Thus, participants made larger adjustments from the reliable
rounded anchors than from the precise anchors, even though they
found the reliable rounded anchors to be more reliable than the
precise anchors. We note that the reliability measures and estimate values differed between the rounded and reliable-rounded
conditions. Thus, it is unlikely that the reliability scale had
different representational properties across conditions (Birnbaum, 1999).
EXPERIMENT 4

If rounded and precise anchors influence scale resolution, then
estimates based on these anchors should diverge more as the
number of units of adjustment increases. For example, suppose
that a rounded anchor evokes a subjective scale with units that
are twice the width of those in a subjective scale evoked by a
precise anchor. Also suppose that the motivation to adjust influences the number of units of adjustment. As the motivation to
adjust increases and the number of units of adjustment increases
correspondingly, the amount of adjustment on the coarse-resolution scale should increase at a faster rate than the amount of
adjustment on the fine-resolution scale (i.e., motivation to adjust
and scale resolution should interact).

Method
Experiment 4 included two subexperiments in which motivation
to adjust and width of the scale unit were manipulated between
subjects. The high-motivation-to-adjust condition was created
by removing information from the scenarios used in Experiment
2 (the scenarios from Experiment 2 were used without alteration
in the low-motivation-to-adjust condition). For example, sentences in the plasma-TV scenario that encouraged a slight adjustment (‘‘items are priced very close to their actual cost . . .
actual cost would be only slightly less than $5,000’’) were replaced with a sentence that encouraged more adjustment (‘‘What
is your estimate of the TV’s actual cost?’’). Experiment 4a (n 5
59) manipulated the width of the scale unit by manipulating the
precision of the anchor (i.e., rounded anchor for broad width and
precise anchor for narrow width). The remainder of the procedure mimicked the procedure in Experiment 1 (e.g., open-ended
responses). Experiment 4b (n 5 149) manipulated width of the
scale unit by replacing the open-ended response format with a
demarcated line. The coarse-unit line had five numerically labeled hatch marks, and the fine-unit line had nine numerically
labeled hatch marks. The endpoint labels and physical line

Volume 19—Number 2

lengths were identical across these conditions. The anchor was
always rounded.

Results
In Experiment 4a, there was a Motivation to Adjust ! Scale Unit
Width interaction, F(1, 55) 5 6.88, prep 5 .947, o2 5 .02. The
difference in the amount of adjustment between the roundedand precise-anchor conditions increased as the motivation to
adjust went from low (Mprecise 5 "0.76, Mrounded 5 "0.23,
Mdifference 5 0.53), F(1, 55) 5 15.76, prep 5 .994, o2 5 .06, to
high (Mprecise 5 "0.04, Mrounded 5 0.98, Mdifference 5 1.02), F(1,
55) 5 60.55, prep 5 .996, o2 5 .25. In Experiment 4b, there was
also a Motivation to Adjust ! Scale Unit Width interaction, F(1,
145) 5 4.01, prep 5 .882, o2 5 .02. The difference in the amount
of adjustment between the two response-line conditions increased as the motivation to adjust went from low (Mfine 5
"0.58, Mcoarse 5 "0.34, Mdifference 5 0.24), F(1, 145) 5 5.15,
prep 5 .917, o2 5 .03, to high (Mfine 5 0.19, Mcoarse 5 0.72,
Mdifference 5 0.53), F(1, 145) 5 26.42, prep 5 .99, o2 5 .15. The
symmetry of results across the two subexperiments suggests that
the precision of an anchor influences the resolution of the underlying subjective response scale.
QUASI-EXPERIMENT 5

Real estate agents are sensitive to numerical anchors (Northcraft & Neale, 1987). We examined the possibility that home
buyers exhibit similar behavior by analyzing 5 years of home
sales data (N 5 25,564) from Alachua County, Florida. First,
each list price was coded as being precise to the ten thousands,
thousands, hundreds, tens, or ones. Discussions with brokers
revealed that prices precise to the tens or ones (n 5 492) often
indicate sales due to foreclosure; because such sales are not
representative home sales, we excluded these data from our
analysis. Second, the sales-price ratio (sale price/list price) was
used to exclude sales that were completed at or above the list
price, as these sales often involved a ‘‘bidding war’’ (n 5
12,491). The final sample included 12,581 homes priced between $600 and $2,000,000 (Mdn 5 $130,000).
After we controlled for the list price, F(1, 12,577) 5 23.88,
there was a main effect of list-price precision on the sales-price
ratio, F(2, 12,577) 5 207.08, o2 5 .015. There was a difference
between the sales-price ratios for list prices that were precise to
the hundreds (M 5 0.950, MSE 5 0.0006) and list prices that
were precise to the thousands (M 5 0.935, MSE 5 0.001), F(1,
12,577) 5 139.51, prep 5 .996, o2 5 .01; there was also a
difference between the sales-price ratios for list prices that were
precise to the thousands and list prices that were precise to the
ten thousands (M 5 0.910, MSE 5 0.003), F(1, 12,577) 5
114.96, prep 5 .996, o2 5 .008. An ancillary analysis showed
that the difference between the amount of adjustment to a
rounded versus a precise anchor increased as the number of days

125

Anchor Precision Influences the Amount of Adjustment

the home was listed on the market increased, F(2, 12,578) 5
8.80, o2 5 .001. For example, the difference between the salesprice ratios for prices precise to the hundreds and prices precise
to the ten thousands increased as the number of days the home
was listed increased from less than 40 days (M100s 5 0.962,
M10,000s 5 0.939, Mdifference 5 0.023) to more than 100 days
(M100s 5 0.936, M10,000s 5 0.886, Mdifference 5 0.05). If the
number of days a home is listed influences the buyer’s motivation
to adjust, then the effect of anchor precision should increase as
the number of days increases.
GENERAL DISCUSSION

The results of the five studies allow us to draw two conclusions,
with different levels of confidence. First, a precise anchor results
in less adjustment than a rounded anchor. The anchor-precision
effect is robust. It occurred with regularity across a large number
of replicates, both inside the laboratory and in the field. Second,
it appears plausible that anchor precision influences resolution
of the subjective scale, which in turn influences the amount that
people adjust from an anchor. This claim is more difficult to
substantiate because the resolution of a subjective scale must be
inferred from response patterns, and because there are other
factors (e.g., objective scale range, confidence in the anchor
value) that also contribute to the amount of adjustment. There
are also other adjustment strategies that might be used (e.g.,
proportion of the anchor value).
The anchor-precision effect may be operative in a large
number of real-world circumstances, influencing negotiations,
assessments of health risk, and assessments of present and future value. For example, Galinsky and Mussweiler (2001) found
that the initial offer in a negotiation acts as an anchor, and hence
has a significant influence on the settlement amount. Our results
suggest that the influence of the initial offer will be stronger
when the initial offer is precise, rather than rounded. Also,
Michie, Lester, Pinto, and Marteau (2005) showed that patients
are sensitive to the manner in which medical information is
communicated. Patients seem to understand estimates of life
expectancy and treatment responsiveness better when such information is presented in general terms (e.g., ‘‘moderate risk,’’
‘‘high risk’’), rather than in specific terms (e.g., 40%, 80%; Brun
& Teigen, 1988). Yet, to the extent that patients adjust initial
estimates to account for family history, personal motivation, and
other variables, general terms may encourage more adjustment
and alter treatment choices.
Anchor precision may also influence the confidence intervals
people use to make decisions. Confidence intervals surrounding
numerical values or estimates influence search for information,
resource allocation, and willingness to execute a decision (Soll
& Klayman, 2004). Yet, despite the importance of estimated
confidence intervals, people are poor at generating them. For
example, when people are asked to make an estimate and surround it with a 90% confidence interval, the interval includes

126

the correct answer about 50% of the time, owing to the interval
being too narrow (Klayman, Soll, González-Vallejo, & Barlas,
1999). One factor that may contribute to the narrowness of such
confidence intervals is the resolution of the subjective scales
used to generate the initial values (Soll & Klayman, 2004). If
people begin the estimation process by generating an initial
estimate, the precision of this initial estimate will influence the
resolution of the subjective scale and the size of the confidence
interval. Thus, policymakers should be able to increase the size
of confidence intervals by encouraging people to generate a
rounded initial estimate, and hence to use a coarse-resolution
subjective scale.
