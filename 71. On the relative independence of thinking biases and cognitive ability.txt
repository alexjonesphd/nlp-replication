In 7 different studies, the authors observed that a large number of thinking biases are uncorrelated with
cognitive ability. These thinking biases include some of the most classic and well-studied biases in the
heuristics and biases literature, including the conjunction effect, framing effects, anchoring effects,
outcome bias, base-rate neglect, “less is more” effects, affect biases, omission bias, myside bias,
sunk-cost effect, and certainty effects that violate the axioms of expected utility theory. In a further
experiment, the authors nonetheless showed that cognitive ability does correlate with the tendency to
avoid some rational thinking biases, specifically the tendency to display denominator neglect, probability
matching rather than maximizing, belief bias, and matching bias on the 4-card selection task. The authors
present a framework for predicting when cognitive ability will and will not correlate with a rational
thinking tendency.
Keywords: thinking biases, heuristics and biases, intelligence, cognitive ability

2002; Stanovich, 1999, 2004), and individual differences in their
operation remain unassessed on IQ tests.
However, there may be reasons for expecting a relationship
between cognitive ability and individual differences in the operation of thinking biases even if the latter are not directly assessed on
intelligence tests. This follows from the fact that theorizing in the
heuristics and biases literature has emphasized dual-process models of cognition (Evans, 2003, 2006, 2007; Kahneman, 2000, 2003;
Kahneman & Frederick, 2002, 2005; Sloman, 1996; Stanovich,
1999, 2004). Such models embody the assumption that thinking
biases are universal properties of a heuristic system that operates
autonomously (called System 1 in dual-process theory; see
Kahneman & Frederick, 2002; Stanovich, 1999). Nonetheless,
although the presence of thinking biases might be universal, their
ability to result in nonnormative choices varies from individual to
individual because heuristic responses are sometimes overridden
by a nonautonomous analytic system of thought (called System 2
in dual-process theory). The computational power needed to override a heuristically primed response and/or the ability to recognize
the need to override might be related to intelligence, thus creating
a (negative) relationship between biased responding and cognitive
ability even though thinking biases are not directly assessed on IQ
tests.
Some research has indicated that cognitive ability is modestly
related to performance on several tasks from the heuristics and
biases literature. Stanovich and West (1997, 1998c, 1998d, 1999,
2000; see also Kokis, Macpherson, Toplak, West, & Stanovich,
2002; Sá, West, & Stanovich, 1999; Toplak & Stanovich, 2002)
found correlations with cognitive ability to be roughly (in absolute
magnitude) .35–.45 for belief bias in syllogistic reasoning, in the
range of .25–.35 for various probabilistic reasoning tasks, in the
range of .20 –.25 for various covariation detection and hypothesis

In psychology and among the lay public alike, assessments of
intelligence and tests of cognitive ability are taken to be the sine
qua non of good thinking. Critics of these instruments often point
out that IQ tests fail to assess many domains of psychological
functioning that are essential. For example, many largely noncognitive domains such as socioemotional abilities, creativity, empathy, and interpersonal skills are almost entirely unassessed by tests
of cognitive ability. However, even these standard critiques of
intelligence tests often contain the unstated assumption that although intelligence tests miss certain key noncognitive areas, they
encompass most of what is important cognitively. In this article, we
attempt to explore this assumption by examining whether measures of
cognitive ability ignore important aspects of thinking itself.
A prime candidate for a cognitive domain not assessed by tests
of intelligence would seem to be the domain of thinking biases.
The study of heuristics and biases has been an active topic in
cognitive psychology for over 3 decades now (Gilovich, Griffin, &
Kahneman, 2002; Kahneman & Tversky, 1973, 1996, 2000; Tversky & Kahneman, 1974, 1983, 1986). Many of these thinking
biases relate to issues of rationality rather than to cognitive capacity (see Over, 2004; Samuels & Stich, 2004; Shafir & LeBoeuf,

testing tasks, .25–.35 on informal reasoning tasks, .15–.20 with
outcome bias measured within subjects, .20 –.40 with performance
in the four-card selection task, .10 –.20 with performance in various disjunctive reasoning tasks, .15–.25 with hindsight bias, .25–
.30 with denominator neglect, and .05–.20 with various indices of
Bayesian reasoning. All correlations were in the expected direction, and all were from studies with 100⫹ participants. Other
investigators have found relationships of a similar effect size
between cognitive ability and a variety of tasks in the heuristics
and biases literature (Bruine de Bruin, Parker, & Fischhoff, 2007;
DeShon, Smith, Chan, & Schmitt, 1998; Handley, Capon, Beveridge, Dennis, & Evans, 2004; Klaczynski & Lavallee, 2005;
Newstead, Handley, Harley, Wright, & Farrelly, 2004; Parker &
Fischhoff, 2005; Perkins & Ritchhart, 2004; Valentine, 1975).
In a commentary on this research on individual differences,
Kahneman (2000) pointed out that the correlations observed may
well have been inflated because most of the relevant studies used
within-subjects designs, which contain cues signalling the necessity of heuristic system override (Bartels, 2006; Fischhoff, Slovic,
& Lichtenstein, 1979; Kahneman & Frederick, 2002; Kahneman &
Tversky, 1982a; Shafir, 1998). He argued that between-subjects
tests of the coherence of responses represent a much stricter
criterion and perhaps a more appropriate one because “much of life
resembles a between-subjects experiment” (Kahneman, 2000, p.
682).
That the mental factors operative in within-subjects designs
might be different from those operative in between-subjects designs suggests that the individual difference factors associated with
biased processing in the two different paradigms might also vary.
LeBoeuf and Shafir (2003) have produced some data indicating
that biases that are assessed within-subjects display different relationships with individual difference variables than biases assessed
between-subjects. They found that various framing effects were
associated with the need for cognition thinking disposition (see
Cacioppo, Petty, Feinstein, & Jarvis, 1996) when evaluated on a
within-subjects basis but were independent of need for cognition
when framing was assessed between subjects.
We know little about the relation between cognitive ability and
the tendency to make coherent judgments in between-subjects
situations. Thus, Kahneman’s (2000; see also Kahneman & Frederick, 2002) conjecture that these less transparent designs would
reduce the observed relationships between cognitive ability and the
judgmental biases mentioned above remains virtually untested. In
the present experiments, we examined a variety of effects from the
heuristics and biases literature to see if cognitive ability was
associated with these biases as they are displayed in betweensubjects paradigms. In the first experiment, we examined some
biases and effects that are among the oldest in the literature
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1972, 1973; Tversky & Kahneman, 1973,
1974, 1983): base-rate neglect, framing effects, conjunction effects, anchoring biases, and outcome bias.

Experiment 1: Classic Heuristics and Biases Effects
Method
Participants
The participants were 434 undergraduate students (102 men and
332 women) recruited through an introductory psychology subject

673

pool at a medium-sized state university in the United States. Their
mean age was 19.0 years (SD ⫽ 1.7). The participants were
randomly assigned to Form A (216 participants) and Form B (218
participants).

Experimental Tasks
Base-rate problem. Kahneman and Tversky’s (1973) muchstudied lawyer/engineer problem was employed as a probe of the
degree of base-rate usage. The two versions were identical except
that the base rates given for the engineers and lawyers were
switched as a between-subjects variable (30 engineers and 70
lawyers in Form A and 70 engineers and 30 lawyers in Form B).
Both groups responded by estimating the probability that the focal
individual was one of the engineers.
Framing problem (Asian disease). This item was based on
Tversky and Kahneman’s (1981) famous disease problem. The
positive (gain) and negative (loss) framing of the problem was a
between-subjects manipulation (Form A was the gain frame and
Form B was the loss frame). Both groups of participants chose a
response on the following scale: “I strongly favor program A” (1);
“I favor program A” (2); “I slightly favor program A” (3); “I
slightly favor program B” (4); “I favor program B” (5); “I strongly
favor program B” (6). Higher scored responses represented more
risk seeking.
Conjunction problem. This problem was based on Tversky
and Kahneman’s (1983) much-studied Linda problem. Participants
read the following: “Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and
very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was
deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice,
and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.”
Participants then used a 6-point scale (1 ⫽ extremely improbable, 2 ⫽ very improbable, 3 ⫽ somewhat probable, 4 ⫽ moderately probable, 5 ⫽ very probable, 6 ⫽ extremely probable) to
indicate the relative probability of three statements that described
Linda. The first two statements were identical for the two groups
of participants as follows: 1) It is ______ that Linda is a teacher in
an elementary school; 2) It is ______ that Linda works in a
bookstore and takes Yoga classes. Each group then read one of two
statements that differed in whether they did or did not contain a
conjunction of two descriptions. Participants getting Form A read
the following: 3) It is ______ that Linda is a bank teller. Participants getting Form B read the following: 3) It is ______ that Linda
is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.
Outcome bias. Our measure of outcome bias derived from a
problem investigated by Baron and Hershey (1988). Participants
receiving Form A read the positive outcome version involving a
55-year-old man who had a heart condition and whose operation
succeeded. Participants evaluated the physician’s decision to go
ahead with the operation (1 ⫽ incorrect, a very bad decision; 2 ⫽
incorrect, all things considered; 3 ⫽ incorrect, but not unreasonable; 4 ⫽ the decision and its opposite are equally good; 5 ⫽
correct, but the opposite would be reasonable too; 6 ⫽ correct, all
things considered; 7 ⫽ clearly correct, an excellent decision).
Participants receiving Form B (negative outcome) evaluated a
medical decision that was designed to be objectively better than
the first: 2% chance of death rather than 8%; 10-year increase in
life expectancy versus 5-year increase, etc. However, it had an
unfortunate negative outcome— death of the patient.

Anchoring and adjustment problems. The two problems used
here were adapted from an anchoring and adjustment problem in
Tversky and Kahneman (1974) and one used by Epley and Gilovich (2004). Prior to making an estimation of a particular value,
participants answered a question containing a small or large anchor
value. The Form A version is given below, with the Form B value
in brackets:
1. Do you think there are more or less than 65 [12] African
countries in the United Nations? (a. more; b. less); How many
African countries do you think are in the United Nations?
_________
2. Is the tallest redwood tree in the world more that 85 [1000]
feet tall? (a. more; b. less); How tall do you think the tallest
redwood tree in the world is? _________

Cognitive Ability Measure
Students were asked to indicate their verbal, mathematical, and
total SAT scores on the demographics form. The mean reported
verbal SAT score of the students was 577 (SD ⫽ 68), the mean
reported mathematical SAT score was 572 (SD ⫽ 69), and the
mean total SAT score was 1149 (SD ⫽ 110). The institution-wide
averages for this university in 2006 were 565, 575, and 1140,
respectively. Several studies have indicated that the correlation
between self-reported SATs and verified SAT scores is in the
range of .80 to .92 (Cassady, 2001; Kuncel, Crede, & Thomas,
2005; Noftle & Robins, 2007) as is the correlation between selfreported and verified grade-point average (Higgins, Peterson, Pihl,
& Lee, 2007). An indication of the validity of the self-reported
scores is that they correlated with a third variable to the same
extent as verified scores. Stanovich and West (1998c) found that
the correlation between a vocabulary test and self-reported SAT
total scores (.49) was quite similar to the .51 correlation between
the vocabulary test and verified total SAT scores in a previous
investigation that used the same vocabulary measure (West &
Stanovich, 1991). These indications of validity are perhaps consistent with the fact that participation in these experiments represents a low-stakes, anonymous situation in which participants have
little reason to misrepresent their SAT scores (in contrast to a more
high-stakes situation where a job or some other benefit may be on
the line).
The total SAT score was used as an index of cognitive ability in
the analyses reported here because it loads highly on psychometric
g (Frey & Detterman, 2004; Unsworth & Engle, 2007). For the
purposes of some of the analyses described below, the 206 students
with SAT scores below the median (1150) were assigned to the
low-SAT group, and the 228 remaining students were assigned to
the high-SAT group. Parallel analyses that are fully continuous and
that did not involve partitioning the sample are also reported.1
One caveat concerning the associations in these studies relates
to the restriction of range in our sample. Certainly, it is true that
individuals with average and above average cognitive ability are
overrepresented in samples composed entirely of university students. Nevertheless, the actual range in cognitive ability found
among college students in the United States is quite large. In the
past 30 years, the percentage of 25- to 29-years-olds in the United
States who have attended college has increased by 50%. By 2002,
58% of these young adults had completed at least 1 or more years
of college, and 29% had received at least a bachelor’s degree (U.S.

Department of Health and Human Services, 2003). However, the
restriction of range in cognitive ability is somewhat greater in our
sample because our participants attended a moderately selective
state university. The SAT total means of our samples are roughly
.60 of a standard deviation above the national mean of 1021
(College Board, 2006). The standard deviation of the distribution
of scores in our sample is roughly .55–.70 of the standard deviation
in the nationally representative sample.

Results
Table 1 displays, for each of the experimental tasks, the mean
response as a function of Form (A vs. B) and cognitive ability
group (low vs. high SAT). The table also contains, for each of the
experimental tasks, an analysis that examines whether the magnitude of the effect or bias demonstrated by the task was moderated
by cognitive ability. This was done by examining, in an analysis of
variance (ANOVA) context, whether the effect of form interacted
with SAT group.
The first analysis indicated that there was a significant base-rate
effect on the engineer/lawyer problem, F(1, 430) ⫽ 35.93, MSE ⫽
472.2, p ⬍ .001. The mean probability that Jack was one of the
engineers was lower in the 30% base-rate condition (60.8% for the
entire sample) than the mean probability that Jack was one of the
engineers in the 70% base-rate condition (73.4% for the entire
sample). However, the effect of base rate failed to interact with
cognitive ability, as the Form ⫻ SAT Group interaction was not
significant, F(1, 430) ⫽ 1.30, MSE ⫽ 472.2. To the extent that
there is any hint of an interaction in the means, it is in the opposite
direction from the expected finding. The low-SAT group was
slightly more sensitive to base rates than was the high-SAT group.
The next task displayed in Table 1 is the disease framing task,
and it is clear that both groups displayed the expected framing
effect on this problem—the loss frame (Form B) resulted in a
greater preference for the risky option. The main effect of frame
type (form) was highly significant, F(1, 430) ⫽ 50.98, MSE ⫽
1.37, p ⬍ .001. However, the effect of frame type failed to interact
with cognitive ability, as the Form ⫻ SAT Group interaction was
not significant, F(1, 430) ⫽ 1.48, MSE ⫽ 1.37. To the extent there

Separate analyses involving the verbal SAT (SAT–V) and the mathematical SAT (SAT–M) score were conducted in parallel to all of the
analyses in this article that employ the SAT total score. Across the studies,
there were few differences between the analyses of the total score and those
employing either of the components, but those that did occur are listed in
this footnote. In Experiment 1, the interaction involving the conjunction
problem occurred for SAT–V but not for SAT–M, and the interaction
involving outcome bias occurred for SAT–M but not for SAT–V. In
Experiment 5, omission bias was more frequent (28.1% vs. 18.5%) in the
group lower in SAT–V, ␹2(1, N ⫽ 458) ⫽ 5.88, p ⬍ .05, but there was no
difference associated with SAT–M. In probabilistic reasoning Problem 1 of
Experiment 8, both SAT–M and SAT–V were correlated with the maximizing response, but the correlation involving SAT-M was higher. In
probabilistic reasoning Problem 1, the point biserial correlation between
responding normatively (MAX) versus nonnormatively (MATCH or
OTHER) and SAT–M was .269, whereas the corresponding correlation
with SAT–V was .151. In probabilistic reasoning Problem 2, the point
biserial correlations between responding normatively (MAX) versus nonnormatively (MATCH or OTHER) and SAT–M and SAT–V were similar
(.183 and .222, respectively).

is any hint of an interaction in the means, it is again in the opposite
direction from the expected finding. The high-SAT group displayed a slightly larger framing effect.
The next task displayed in Table 1 is the conjunction problem
(Linda problem). The means of both groups displayed the expected
conjunction fallacy—Linda was judged more probably a feminist
bank teller than a bank teller. The main effect of form was highly
significant, F(1, 430) ⫽ 120.5, MSE ⫽ 1.18, p ⬍ .001. There was

direction from the expected finding—the high-SAT group was
more susceptible to the conjunction fallacy.
The next task displayed in Table 1 is the outcome bias problem.
The means of both groups displayed the expected outcome bias—the
decision with the positive outcome was rated as a better decision than
the decision with the negative outcome, despite the fact that the latter
was objectively better. The main effect of outcome (form) was highly

significant, F(1, 430) ⫽ 20.50, MSE ⫽ 1.13, p ⬍ .001. There was a

MSE ⫽ 1.13, p ⬍ .05, although the size of the effect was small (␩2p ⫽
.009). This interaction was in the expected direction—the low-SAT
group displayed more outcome bias.
The remaining two analyses in Table 1 concern the two anchoring and adjustment problems. In the African countries item, it is
clear that both groups displayed the expected anchoring effect—
the large anchor resulted in higher estimates of the number of
African countries in the United Nations (M ⫽ 42.6 for the entire
sample) than did the small anchor (M ⫽ 14.9 for the entire
sample). The number of African countries in the United Nations is
actually 53. The main effect of anchor magnitude (form) was
highly significant, F(1, 430) ⫽ 219.1, MSE ⫽ 381.4, p ⬍ .001.
However, the effect of anchor magnitude failed to interact with
cognitive ability, as the Form ⫻ SAT Group interaction was not
significant, F(1, 430) ⫽ 2.53, MSE ⫽ 381.4.
Results were similar for the redwoods problem. Both groups
displayed the expected anchoring effect—the large anchor resulted
in higher estimates of the height of the tallest redwood (mean of
989.0 ft for the entire sample) than did the small anchor (mean of
127.4 ft for the entire sample). The tallest redwood tree is actually
370 ft in height. The main effect of anchor magnitude (form) was
highly significant, F(1, 426) ⫽ 461.0, MSE ⫽ 171,862, p ⬍ .001.
However, the effect of anchor magnitude failed to interact with
cognitive ability, as the Form ⫻ SAT Group interaction was not
significant, F(1, 426) ⫽ 0.05, MSE ⫽ 171,862.
Thus, across all of the ANOVAs, only two of the six interactions
between form and cognitive ability were statistically significant,
and only one of these (that for outcome bias) was in the direction
of reduced judgmental bias on the part of the group higher in
cognitive ability. Of course, some information is lost—and power
reduced— by dichotomizing on the cognitive ability variable
(SAT). Thus, Table 1 also presents the results of a continuous
analysis for each task in which the significance of the Form ⫻
Cognitive Ability interaction was tested in a regression analysis in
which SAT was used as a continuous variable rather than as a
dichotomous variable. Immediately below the ANOVA in Table 1
is presented the F ratio for the test of the interaction: the Form ⫻
SAT cross product when entered third in the equation predicting
item response after form and SAT. Along with the F ratio is
presented the R2 change for the interaction. These and all subsequent regression analyses were conducted with centered predictors.
The regression analyses converged completely with the results
from the ANOVAs. Only two of the six interaction terms reached
statistical significance, and only one of those (that for outcome
bias) was in the expected direction—the degree of outcome bias
was larger for the group lower on the SAT. The significant
interaction term for the Linda problem indicated a data pattern in
the opposite direction—the conjunction fallacy was displayed to a
greater extent by the group with higher SAT scores.
In summary, Experiment 1 produced very little evidence indicating that cognitive ability was related to judgmental biases when
the latter were assessed in between-subjects designs. In six comparisons involving five different classic effects from the heuristics
and biases literature, only one comparison provided any indication
that cognitive ability attenuated a judgmental bias. Even in that
case (outcome bias), the effect was extremely modest. The vari-

ance associated with the interaction effect was less than 1% in both
the ANOVA and in the regression analysis.

Experiment 2: “Less is More” Effects
It has been proven through several formal analyses that if
people’s preferences follow certain logical patterns (the so-called
axioms of choice), then they are behaving as if they are maximizing utility (Dawes, 1998; Edwards, 1954; Jeffrey, 1983; Luce &
Raiffa, 1957; Savage, 1954; von Neumann & Morgenstern, 1944).
Much empirical work has gone into determining whether humans
adhere to the axioms of choice (transitivity, independence, reduction of compound lotteries, etc.). However, a between-subjects
comparison makes it possible to test an even simpler requirement
of rational choice—that people can be framed into preferring more
to less (e.g., preferring $6 to $5). For example, Slovic, Finucane,
Peters, and MacGregor (2002) found that people rated a gamble
with 7/36 chance to win $9 and 29/36 to lose 5¢ more favorably
than a gamble with 7/36 chance to win $9 and 29/36 chance to win
nothing. Indeed, they reported that the latter gamble was even
rated less desirable than a gamble having a 7/36 chance to win $9
and 29/36 to lose 25¢. Presumably, in a between-subjects design,
the representation of the numerically small loss highlights the
magnitude and desirability of the $9 to be won.
Likewise, the phenomenon of proportion dominance can result
in people preferring less to more in a between-subjects design.
Slovic et al. (2002) reported a study in which people rated a safety
measure that would save 150 lives less favorably than a safety
measure that would save 98% of 150 lives at risk (see also Bartels,
2006; Slovic & Peters, 2006). Their explanation of this “less is
more” effect exhibited in a between-subjects design is that saving
150 lives is more diffusely good than saving 98% of some target
figure because the 98% is more evaluable (see Bartels, 2006; Hsee,
Loewenstein, Blount, & Bazerman, 1999; Hsee & Zhang,
2004)—it is close to the upper bound on a percentage scale. In the
present experiment, we examined whether any of these “less is
more” effects attenuate as the cognitive ability of the participant
sample increases.

Method
Participants
The participants were 361 undergraduate students (149 men and
212 women) recruited through an introductory psychology subject
pool at a medium-sized state university. Their mean age was 19.2
years (SD ⫽ 1.5). None had participated in Experiment 1. The
participants were randomly assigned to Form A (122 participants),
Form B (119 participants), or Form C (120 participants).
The mean reported verbal SAT score of the students was 586
(SD ⫽ 68), the mean reported mathematical SAT score was 596
(SD ⫽ 66), and the mean total SAT score was 1182 (SD ⫽ 107).
For the purposes of some of the analyses described below, the 183
students with SAT scores at or below the median (1190) were
assigned to the low-SAT group, and the 178 remaining students
were assigned to the high-SAT group.

Experimental Tasks
Gamble. Participants receiving Form A evaluated the following proposition: “I would find a game that had a 7/36 chance of

THINKING BIASES

winning $9 and a 29/36 chance of winning nothing extremely
attractive.” Participants responded on a 6-point scale: strongly
agree (6), moderately agree (5), slightly agree (4), slightly disagree (3), moderately disagree (2), and strongly disagree (1).
Participants receiving Form B evaluated the following proposition:
“I would find a game that had a 7/36 chance of winning $9 and a
29/36 chance of losing 5¢ extremely attractive.” Participants receiving Form C evaluated the following proposition: “I would find
a game that had a 7/36 chance of winning $9 and a 29/36 chance
of losing 25¢ extremely attractive.”
Proportion dominance Problem 1.
Participants receiving
Form A evaluated the following version:
Imagine that highway safety experts have determined that a substantial number of people are at risk of dying in a type of automobile fire.
A requirement that every car have a built-in fire extinguisher (estimated cost, $300) would save the 150 people who would otherwise
die every year in this type of automobile fire. Rate the following
statement about yourself: I would be extremely supportive of this
requirement.

Participants responded on a 6-point scale ranging from strongly
agree (6) to strongly disagree (1). Participants receiving Form B
evaluated a version in which the text read “98% of the 150 people”
in place of “the 150 people.” Participants receiving Form C evaluated a version in which the text read “95% of the 150 people” in
place of “the 150 people.”
Proportion dominance Problem 2.
Participants receiving
Form A evaluated the following version:

677

You have recently graduated from the University, obtained a good
job, and are buying a new car. A newly designed seatbelt has just
become available that would save the lives of the 500 drivers a year
who are involved in a type of head-on-collision. (Approximately half of
these fatalities involve drivers who were not at fault.) The newly designed
seatbelt is not yet standard on most car models. However, it is available
as a $500 option for the car model that you are ordering. How likely is it
that you would order your new car with this optional seatbelt?

Participants responded on a 6-point scale ranging from very
likely to very unlikely. Participants receiving Form B evaluated a
version in which the text read “98% of the 500 drivers” in place of
“the 500 drivers.” Participants receiving Form C evaluated a
version in which the text read “95% of the 500 drivers” in place of
“the 500 drivers.”

Results
Table 2 displays, for each of the three “less is more” problems,
the mean response as a function of Form (A, B, C) and cognitive
ability group (low vs. high). The Table also contains, for each of
the three problems, an analysis that examines whether the magnitude of the “less is more” effect was moderated by cognitive
ability. This was done by examining whether the effect of form
interacted with SAT group—first in an ANOVA context and then
in a fully continuous regression analysis.
The first analysis indicated that there was a significant “less is
more” effect on the gamble problem. The higher expected value
gamble with no possibility of loss was rated as a less appealing

the possibility of loss, F(2, 355) ⫽ 12.54, MSE ⫽ 2.62, p ⬍ .001.
There was a significant Condition ⫻ Cognitive Ability interaction,
F(2, 355) ⫽ 5.91, MSE ⫽ 2.62, p ⬍ .01, although the effect was
modest (␩2p ⫽ .032). This interaction was in the expected direction—
the low-SAT group displayed more of a “less is more” effect. The
high-SAT group rated the lose-5¢ condition similarly to the losenothing condition, whereas the low-SAT group rated the latter as
considerably less attractive. However, the impressively rational performance of the high-SAT group in the lose-5¢ condition was somewhat impeached by their performance in the lose-25¢ condition,
which they rated as considerably more attractive than the lose-nothing
condition. Thus, both groups proved susceptible to a “less is more”
effect, but the high-SAT simply proved somewhat less susceptible.
The next analysis indicated that there was also a significant “less
is more” effect on proportion dominance Problem 1. The proposal
for the fire extinguisher that saved 95% of 150 lives and the one
that saved 98% of 150 lives were rated higher than the proposal for the
fire extinguisher that saved 150 lives, F(2, 355) ⫽ 5.02, MSE ⫽ 1.46,
p ⬍ .01. There was no significant Condition ⫻ Cognitive Ability
interaction, F(2, 355) ⫽ 1.78, MSE ⫽ 1.46, ns. To the extent that there
is any hint of an interaction in the means, it is in the opposite direction
from the expected finding. The high-SAT group displayed a slightly
larger “less is more” effect on this problem.
The last analysis indicates that there was also a significant “less
is more” effect on proportion dominance Problem 2. The seatbelt
that saved 95% of 500 lives and the one that saved 98% of 500
lives were rated more highly than the seatbelt that saved 500 lives,
F(2, 355) ⫽ 3.66, MSE ⫽ 2.04, p ⬍ .05. There was no significant
Condition ⫻ Cognitive Ability interaction, F(2, 355) ⫽ 1.27,
MSE ⫽ 2.04, ns. As with proportion dominance Problem 1, any
hint of an interaction in the means is in the opposite direction from
the expected finding. The high-SAT group displayed a slightly
larger “less is more” effect on this problem.
Also presented in Table 2 are the results of regression analyses in
which SAT was used as a continuous variable rather than as a
dichotomous variable. Immediately below the ANOVA in Table 2 is
presented the F ratio for the test of the interaction: the Form ⫻ SAT
cross product when entered third in the equation predicting item
response after form and SAT. Along with the F ratio is presented the
R2 change for the interaction. The regression analyses converged
completely with the results from the ANOVAs. Only the interaction
in the gamble problem was statistically significant.
This experiment produced very little evidence that cognitive ability
attenuates “less is more” effects in between-subjects designs. In two
items that display a proportion dominance effect, there was no statistically significant tendency for higher SAT participants to show less
proportion dominance. On the gamble problem, there was a tendency
for the “less is more” effect to be smaller among high-SAT participants. The size of the interaction was small, however (␩2p ⫽ .032).
Also, high-SAT participants did display a robust “less is more” effect
when the comparison involved the 25¢-loss condition—ironically, the
one with the lowest expected value.

negative expected value activity because a significant investment
has already been made (Arkes & Ayton, 1999; Arkes & Blumer,
1985). Additionally, we examined the economically inefficient
tendency to pursue the maximum relative savings rather than the
maximum absolute savings (Thaler, 1980; Tversky & Kahneman,
1981).

Method
Participants
The 729 participants in this experiment (249 men and 480
women) were recruited as in the previous two experiments. None
had participated in Experiments 1 or 2. The mean reported total
SAT score was 1167 (SD ⫽ 102). For the purposes of the analyses
described below, the 364 students with SAT scores below the
median (1180) were assigned to the low-SAT group, and the 365
remaining students were assigned to the high-SAT group.

Experimental Tasks
Sunk-cost fallacy. The participants were randomly assigned to
the no-sunk-cost condition and the sunk-cost condition. The nosunk-cost group read the following problem:
Imagine that Video Connection rents videos for $1.50. Low Priced
Videos, a competitor, rents videos for just $2.00 each. Although the
Video Connection store is ten minutes away by car, the Low Priced
Videos is only about 1/2 block from your apartment. Assuming that
you only rent from these two stores, how many of your next 20 videos
rentals would be from the closer but more expensive Low Priced
Videos?

Participants then responded on a 10-point scale: 0 –1 (1), 2–3
(2), 4 –5 (3), 6 –7 (4), 8 –9 (5), 10 –11 (6), 11–12 (7), 13–14 (8),
15–16 (9), and 17–20 (10). Responses to this item establish how
likely participants are to choose convenience over a discount when
they have not already paid for the privilege of the discount. The
sunk-cost group read a similar scenario but one in which the choice
was between convenience and a discount when the cost of the
privilege of the discount had already been sunk:
Imagine that you just paid $50 for a Video Connection discount card
that allows you to rent videos for 50% off the regular price of $3.00.
Soon after you purchased the Video Connection discount card, Low
Priced Videos, a competitor, opened a new store that rents videos for
just $2.00 each. Although the Video Connection store is ten minutes
away by car, the new Low Priced Videos is only about 1/2 block from
your apartment. Assuming that you only rent from these two stores,
how many of your next 20 videos rentals would be from the closer but
more expensive Low Priced Videos?

Experiment 3: Honoring Sunk Costs and Absolute Versus
Relative Savings

Participants responded on the same 10-point scale.
Absolute versus relative savings.
This task was based on
comparison problems introduced by Thaler (1980; see also Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). Participants received either a large
percentage of savings (Form 1) or a small percentage of savings
(Form 2) framing form of the problem. The Form 1 version is
given below:

In this experiment, we examined the nonnormative economic
behavior of honoring sunk costs—the tendency to persist in a

Imagine that you go to purchase a calculator for $30. The calculator
salesperson informs you that the calculator you wish to buy is on sale

THINKING BIASES
for $20 at the other branch of the store which is ten minutes away by
car. Would you drive to the other store? Option A: Yes, Option B: No

The Form 2 version is given below:
Imagine that you go to purchase a jacket for $250. The jacket
salesperson informs you that the jacket you wish to buy is on sale for
$240 at the other branch of the store which is ten minutes away by car.
Would you drive to the other store? Option A: Yes, Option B: No

Previous research has found more participants willing to make
the trip to save $10 for the calculator than for the jacket, thus
violating the standard analysis of consumer behavior, which views
the two versions as equivalent choices between traveling and
gaining $10 versus the status quo (Thaler, 1980; Tversky &
Kahneman, 1981).

Results
The sunk-cost paradigm used in this experiment was successful
in creating a sunk-cost effect. The mean score of 6.71 (SD ⫽ 2.9)
in the no-sunk-cost condition (corresponding to roughly 11 videos)
was significantly higher than the mean score of 4.61 (SD ⫽ 3.2) in
the sunk-cost condition (corresponding to roughly 7.5 videos),
t(727) ⫽ 9.33, p ⬍ .001, Cohen’s d ⫽ 0.692. Both cognitive ability
groups displayed sunk-cost effects of roughly equal magnitude.
For the high-SAT group, the mean in the no-sunk-cost condition
was 6.90 and the mean in the sunk-cost condition was 5.08,
whereas for the low-SAT group, the mean in the no-sunk-cost
condition was 6.50 and the mean in the sunk-cost condition was
4.19. A 2 (cognitive ability) ⫻ 2 (condition) ANOVA indicated a
significant main effect of cognitive ability, F(1, 725) ⫽ 8.40,
MSE ⫽ 9.13, p ⬍ .01, and a significant main effect of condition,
F(1, 725) ⫽ 84.9, MSE ⫽ 9.13, p ⬍ .001. There was a slight
tendency for the low-SAT participants to show a larger sunk-cost
effect, but the Cognitive Ability ⫻ Condition interaction did not
attain statistical significance, F(1, 725) ⫽ 1.21, MSE ⫽ 9.13. The
interaction was also tested in a regression analyses in which SAT
was treated as a continuous variable rather than as a dichotomous
variable. The Form ⫻ SAT cross product, when entered third in
the equation, was not significant, F(1, 725) ⫽ 0.32.
The sunk-cost effect thus represents another cognitive bias that
is not strongly attenuated by cognitive ability. However, this is true
only when it is assessed in a between-subjects context. Using a
similar sunk-cost problem, Stanovich and West (1999) did find an
association with cognitive ability when participants responded in a
within-subjects design.
Results on the percentage versus absolute savings problem were
consistent with previous research. More participants were willing
to drive 10 min when the resulting $10 savings constituted a
substantially larger percentage of the cost of the purchase. For the
high-SAT group, 88.3% were willing to drive to save $10 on the
$30 calculator, but only 55.9% would drive to save $10 on the
$250 jacket, ␹2(1, N ⫽ 365) ⫽ 47.14, p ⬍ .001. These values for
the low-SAT group were, respectively, 86.9% and 62.0%, ␹2(1,

study, a logistic regression analysis indicated that the interaction

relative over absolute savings was not moderated by cognitive
ability.

Experiment 4: Nonseparability of Risk and Benefit
Judgments
Slovic et al. (2002; Slovic & Peters, 2006) have suggested that
judgments about the risks and benefits of various activities and
technologies derive not from separable knowledge sources relevant to risk and benefit but instead derive from a common
source—affect. Evidence for this conjecture derives from the finding that ratings of risk and reward are negatively correlated (Finucane, Alhakami, Slovic, & Johnson, 2000; Slovic & Peters, 2006),
both across activities within participants and across participants
within activities. When something is rated as having high benefits,
it tends to be seen as having low risk, and when something is rated
as having high risk, it is seen as having low benefits. Finucane et
al. (2000) argued that such a finding is nonnormative because the
risk/benefit relationship is most likely positive in a natural ecology. Their argument is that of the four cells in a high/low partitioning of risk and benefit, one of the cells—that for activities of
high risk and low benefit—must be vastly underpopulated. This is
because activities of this type are usually not adopted, and they are
often proscribed by authorities even when they are. If the highrisk, low-benefit quadrant is underpopulated, then the overall
risk/benefit of activities in the actual world must be positively
correlated. In the present study, we investigated whether the nonnormative tendency to view risk and reward as negatively correlated is attenuated in individuals high in cognitive ability.

Method
The 458 participants in this experiment (112 men and 346
women) were recruited as in the previous experiments, and their
mean age was 18.8 years (SD ⫽ 1.8). None of them had participated in previous experiments. The mean reported verbal SAT
score of the students was 565 (SD ⫽ 74), the mean reported
mathematical SAT score was 570 (SD ⫽ 78), and the mean total
SAT score was 1135 (SD ⫽ 127). The 231 students with SAT
scores at or below the median (1140) were assigned to the lowSAT group, and the 227 remaining students were assigned to the
high-SAT group. Participants were asked to rate the benefits and
risks of the following technologies/products: bicycles, alcoholic
beverages, chemical plants, pesticides. Participants were first
asked to rate the technology/product on a 7-point scale ranging
from not at all beneficial (1) to very beneficial (7). They then rated
the relative risk of the technology/product on a 7-point scale
ranging from not at all risky (1) to very risky (7).

Results
Finucane et al. (2000) used three methods to assess the relationship between judgments of benefit and risk. First, they examined
the mean risk/benefit ratings given to 23 different activities/
technologies and then calculated the correlation across the 23
items. Second, they calculated the correlation, across the 23 items,
of the ratings of each individual participant. Finally, Finucane et al.
(2000) examined, within each activity, whether those who rated
the activity as having large benefits perceived it as having low risk

STANOVICH AND WEST

680

and vice versa. All three of these methods yielded a preponderance
of negative correlations. Because we examined only four different
activities/technologies, we were restricted to the third method of
calculating the correlation between risk and benefit.
Table 3 presents the mean benefit and risk rating for each of the
four activities/technologies. Not surprisingly, bicycles were rated
of highest benefit and lowest risk. Alcoholic beverages, in contrast
were rated relatively low in benefit and high in risk. Most relevant,
however, are the correlations between benefit and risk within each
of the four items. These correlations are presented for both the
high-SAT and low-SAT group. Replicating the work of Finucane
et al. (2000), all eight of the correlations were negative and seven
of the eight were statistically significant. For each of the four
activities/technologies, people who saw the activity as very beneficial saw it as lower in risk, and those who saw it as lower in
benefit tended to see it as somewhat higher in risk.
The nonnormative tendency to view risk and reward as negatively correlated was not attenuated by high cognitive ability
within the range that we studied. In fact, each of the four negative
correlations were higher in the high-SAT group than in the lowSAT group. However, none of the differences between the correlations were significant when a Fisher z test (values of 1.51, 0.12,
0.45, and 1.12, respectively) was used.

4. I would definitely take the vaccine. I would thus accept the 5%

Results
Explicit omission bias (the tendency to avoid the treatment—
that is choosing either Alternative 1 or 2 on the scale) was a
minority phenomenon among both cognitive ability groups. However, it was equally common in both groups. In the high-SAT
group, 25.6% of the participants displayed some degree of omission bias, whereas 30.3% of the low-SAT group displayed some
degree of omission bias, a difference that was not statistically
significant, ␹2(1, N ⫽ 236) ⫽ 0.62. As a convergent, fully continuous analysis we correlated the response on the scale with the
SAT total score and observed a nonsignificant correlation of .057.
Thus, neither analysis indicated that there was statistically reliable
evidence that omission bias was associated with cognitive ability
in range studied in this investigation.

Experiment 5: Omission Bias
Omission bias is the tendency to avoid actions that carry some
risk but that would prevent a larger risk (Baron, 1998; Baron &
Ritov, 2004; Bazerman, Baron, & Shonk, 2001). People often do
not realize that by failing to act they often subject themselves and
others to greater risk. In Experiment 5, we examined whether the
extent of omission bias was attenuated by cognitive ability.

Method
The participants were 236 of the participants who completed the
tasks of Experiment 4. Participants read the following problem:
Imagine that there will be a deadly flu going around your area next
winter. Your doctor says that you have a 10% chance (10 out of 100)
of dying from this flu. However, a new flu vaccine has been developed and tested. If taken, the vaccine prevents you from catching the
deadly flu. However, there is one serious risk involved with taking
this vaccine. The vaccine is made from a somewhat weaker type of flu
virus, and there is a 5% (5 out of 100) risk of the vaccine causing you
to die from the weaker type of flu. Imagine that this vaccine is
completely covered by health insurance. If you had to decide now,
which would you choose?

Experiment 6: Reference Dependent Preferences—WTA/
WTP and the Certainty Effect
The theory of reference-dependent preferences (Kahneman &
Tversky, 1979, 1984; Tversky & Kahneman, 1991) predicts a large
difference in willingness-to-accept (WTA) and willingness-to-pay
(WTP) valuations. In this experiment, we examined individual
differences in WTA/WTP discrepancies and also another effect
predicted by prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979)—the
certainty effect. Prospect theory predicts that people overweight
probability differences that make an outcome certain over similar
probability differences that do not (a violation of the standard
assumptions of utility theory).

Method
Thaler problem.
The 164 participants (70 men and 94
women) completing this problem in this experiment were recruited
as in the previous experiments. The 86 students with SAT scores
below the median (1160) were assigned to the low-SAT group, and
the 78 remaining students were assigned to the high-SAT group.

THINKING BIASES

Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions—
WTP certainty, WTA certainty, and WTP noncertainty. WTPcertainty and WTA-certainty conditions were based on a problem
discussed by Thaler (1980). The WTP-certainty group read the
following problem:
Imagine that when you went to the movies last week, you were
inadvertently exposed to a rare and fatal virus. The possibility of
actually contracting the disease is 1 in 1,000, but once you have the
illness there is no known cure. On the other hand, you can, readily and
now, be given an injection that stops the development of the illness.
Unfortunately, these injections are only available in very small quantities and are sold to the highest bidder. What is the highest price you
would be prepared to pay for such an injection? [You can get a long-term,
low-interest loan if needed.]: $10 [scored as 1]; $100 [scored as 2];
$1,000 [scored as 3]; $10,000 [scored as 4]; $50,000 [scored as 5];
$100,000 [scored as 6]; $250,000 [scored as 7]; $500,000 [scored as 8];
$1,000,000 [scored as 9]; $5,000,000 or more [scored as 10; logarithmic
scoring schemes resulted in essentially identical results].

The WTA-certainty group read the following problem and answered on the same scale:
Imagine that a group of research scientists in the School of Medicine
are running a laboratory experiment on a vaccine for a rare and fatal
virus. The possibility of actually contracting the disease from the
vaccine is 1 in 1,000, but once you have the disease there is no known
cure. The scientists are seeking volunteers to test the vaccine on. What
is the lowest amount that you would have to be paid before you would
take part in this experiment?

The WTP-noncertainty group read the following problem and
answered on the same scale:
Imagine that when you went to the movies last week, you were
inadvertently exposed to a rare and fatal virus. The possibility of
actually contracting the disease is 4 in 1,000, but once you have the
illness there is no known cure. On the other hand, you can, readily and
now, be given an injection that reduces the possibility of contracting
the disease to 3 in 1,000. Unfortunately, these injections are only
available in very small quantities and are sold to the highest bidder.
What is the highest price you would be prepared to pay for such an
injection? [You can get a long-term, low-interest loan if needed.]

The Allais problem. The participants in this experiment were
the same as those who participated in Experiment 3. The Allais
problem was modeled on Allais’s (1953) famous two-choice problem wherein participants sometimes violate the so-called independence axiom of utility theory—that if the outcome in some state of
the world is the same across options, then that state of the world
should be ignored. Approximately one half of the participants
received Form 1 of the problem:
Choose between:
A: One million dollars for sure
B: .89 probability of one million dollars
.10 probability of five million dollars
.01 probability of nothing

Approximately one half of the participants received Form 2 of the
problem:
Choose between:
C: .11 probability of one million dollars
.89 probability of nothing

681

D: .10 probability of five million dollars
.90 probability of nothing

The typical finding is that most people select Option A in Form
1 and Option D in Form 2, but these choices violate the independence axiom (the outcome of the .89 slice of probability is the
same in A and B as it is in C and D). Although many theorists have
discussed why individuals finding Option D attractive might nonetheless be drawn to Option A in the first problem (Bell, 1982;
Loomes & Sugden, 1982; Maher, 1993; Schick, 1987; Slovic &
Tversky, 1974), relatively little is known about the influence that
cognitive ability might have on preferences on this problem.

Results
There was a significant WTA/WTP difference displayed in Experiment 6. The mean score of 7.49 (SD ⫽ 2.89) in the WTA-certainty
condition was significantly higher than the mean score of 5.76 (SD ⫽
2.68) in the WTP-certainty condition, t(105) ⫽ 3.21, p ⬍ .01, Cohen’s
d ⫽ 0.627). Participants would require between $250,000 and
$500,000 to take on the 1 in 1,000 risk of the disease but would pay
only $50,000 to $100,000 to have the 1 in 1,000 probability of the
disease removed. There was also a significant certainty effect displayed in Experiment 6. The mean score of 5.76 (SD ⫽ 2.68) in the
WTP-certainty condition was significantly higher than the mean score
of 3.87 (SD ⫽ 2.64) in the WTP-noncertainty condition, t(106) ⫽
3.69, p ⬍ .001, Cohen’s d ⫽ 0.717). Participants would pay $50,000
to $100,000 to have the probability of the disease entirely removed
but only between $1,000 and $10,000 to have the likelihood of the
disease reduced by the same probability.
As indicated in Table 4, both cognitive ability groups displayed
WTA/WTP discrepancies and certainty effects of roughly equal
magnitude. A 2 (cognitive ability) ⫻ 3 (condition) ANOVA indicated that there was a significant main effect of condition, F(2,
152) ⫽ 20.61, MSE ⫽ 7.44, p ⬍ .001, but no significant main

interaction did not attain statistical significance, F(2, 152) ⫽ 0.41,
MSE ⫽ 7.44. Neither the WTA/WTP discrepancy nor the certain
effect was attenuated by cognitive ability.
The same was true of the responses to the Allais problems.
Consistent with previous research on this problem, the majority of
participants chose Option A for Form 1, whereas only a minority
of participants selected the analogous Option C for Form 2. For the
high-SAT group, the percentages for Options A and C were,
respectively, 55.3% and 28.0%, ␹2(1, N ⫽ 365) ⫽ 28.13, p ⬍ .001.
These values for the low-SAT group were, respectively, 74.2% and
33.7%, ␹2(1, N ⫽ 364) ⫽ 60.07, p ⬍ .001. Of particular interest
in the present study, a logistic regression analysis indicated that the
interaction between SAT group and Allais problem form failed to
reach significance, ␤ ⫽ 0.57, ␹2(1, N ⫽ 729) ⫽ 3.21, p ⫽ .073.

Stanovich, 2005; Stanovich & West, 2007; Toplak & Stanovich,
2003). It is easy to disguise the intent of an experiment on myside bias
by using a between-subjects manipulation, as we show in Experiment
7.

Method
The participants were the same 458 participants who completed
the tasks of Experiments 4 and 5. Participants were randomly
assigned to the myside (Ford Explorer) and otherside (German car)
groups. The Ford Explorer group read the following problem:
According to a comprehensive study by the U.S. Department of
Transportation, Ford Explorers are 8 times more likely than a typical
family car to kill occupants of another car in a crash. The Department
of Transportation in Germany is considering recommending a ban on
the sale of the Ford Explorer in Germany. Do you think that Germany
should ban the sale of the Ford Explorer?

Participants answered on the following scale: definitely yes (6), yes
(5), probably yes (4), probably no (3), no (2), definitely no (1).
Participants were also asked: “Should the Ford Explorer be allowed on German streets, just like other cars?” They answered on
the same scale as the previous question.
The German car group read the following problem:
According to a comprehensive study by the U.S. Department of
Transportation, a particular German car is 8 times more likely than a
typical family car to kill occupants of another car in a crash. The U.S.

Department of Transportation is considering recommending a ban on
the sale of this German car.

Participants answered the following two questions on the scale
presented above: (1) Do you think that the United States should
ban the sale of this car? (2) Do you think that this car should be
allowed on U.S. streets, just like other cars?

Results
The paradigm used in this experiment was successful in creating
a myside bias effect. On the “ban the sale” of the car question, the
mean for the Ford Explorer (myside) condition was significantly
lower (3.61, SD ⫽ 1.23) than the mean for the German car
(otherside) condition (4.34, SD ⫽ 1.23), t(456) ⫽ ⫺6.33, p ⬍
.001, Cohen’s d ⫽ 0.593. Participants were more likely to think
that the German car should be banned in the U.S. than they were
to think that the Ford Explorer should be banned in Germany.
Correspondingly, on the “allowed on the streets like other cars”
question, the mean for the Ford Explorer (myside) condition was
significantly higher (3.82, SD ⫽ 1.19) than the mean for the
German car (otherside) condition (2.86, SD ⫽ 1.20), t(456), ⫽
8.59, p ⬍ .001, Cohen’s d ⫽ 0.805. Participants were more likely
to think that the Ford Explorer should be allowed on German
streets like other cars than they were to think that the German car
should be allowed on U.S. streets like other cars.

Germany and against the rights of the German car in the United
States was not attenuated by cognitive ability in the range studied
in this sample.

Experiment 8: Heuristics and Biases That Do Associate
With Cognitive Ability
In the previous seven experiments, we have shown that a wide
variety of cognitive biases are dissociated from cognitive ability.
However, we do not mean to imply that effects from the heuristics
and biases literature are invariably independent of intelligence. To
the contrary, in the introduction we mentioned several biases in
which there has been at least some suggestion of an association. In
this experiment, we collected together several such effects, including several well-known logical reasoning and probabilistic reasoning tasks and biases.

Method and Results
Probabilistic Reasoning: Denominator Neglect
This probabilistic reasoning task was a marble game that was
modeled on a task introduced by Kirkpatrick and Epstein (1992;
see also Denes-Raj & Epstein, 1994; Pacini & Epstein, 1999). The
task read as follows:
Assume that you are presented with two trays of black and white
marbles, a large tray that contains 100 marbles and a small tray that
contains 10 marbles. The marbles are spread in a single layer in each
tray. You must draw out one marble (without peeking, of course) from
either tray. If you draw a black marble you win $2. Consider a
condition in which the small tray contains 1 black marble and 9 white
marbles, and the large tray contains 8 black marbles and 92 white
marbles [a visual of each tray was presented to participants]. From
which tray would you prefer to select a marble in a real situation?:
____ the small tray ____ the large tray.

The normative response is of course to select the small tray,
because it has the highest probability (10% vs. 8%) of yielding a
winning black marble. Nonetheless, Epstein and colleagues (see
also Klaczynski, 2001; Kokis et al., 2002) have found that a
significant minority of participants choose the large tray. Kokis et

683

al. (2002) found, in a sample of children, a significant .28 correlation between cognitive ability and the tendency to choose the
small tray. However, little is known about the nature of the
correlation in an adult sample.
The 819 participants in this experiment (179 men and 640
women) were recruited in the same manner as in all the previous
studies, but none had participated in previous experiments. Their
mean reported total SAT score was 1161 (SD ⫽ 105). A substantial number of participants displayed denominator neglect in the
marble task. Although a majority of participants (519 — 63.4%)
picked the normatively correct small tray, 300 of the participants
(36.6%) chose the large tray, thus displaying denominator neglect.
The tendency to respond normatively in this task was, however,
significantly associated with cognitive ability. The mean SAT
score of the participants choosing the small tray (1174, SD ⫽ 107)
was significantly higher than the mean score of those choosing the
large tray (1137, SD ⫽ 99), t(817) ⫽ 4.90, p ⬍ .001, Cohen’s d ⫽
0.356. The point biserial correlation between tray choice and SAT
total was .169 ( p ⬍ .001). Unlike the effects and biases discussed
in Experiments 1–7, the phenomenon of denominator neglect in
this probabilistic choice paradigm was related to cognitive ability.

Probabilistic Reasoning: Probability Matching Versus
Maximizing
Problem 1. Modified from West and Stanovich (2003), this
problem read as follows:
Consider the following hypothetical situation: A deck with 10 cards is
randomly shuffled 10 separate times. The 10 cards are composed of 7
cards with the number “1” on the down side and 3 cards with the
number “2” on the down side. Each time the 10 cards are reshuffled,
your task is to predict the number on the down side of the top card.
Imagine that you will receive $100 for each downside number you
correctly predict, and that you want to earn as much money as
possible. What would you predict after shuffle #1? (1 or 2); What
would you predict after shuffle #2? (1 or 2); . . . What would you
predict after shuffle #10? (1 or 2).

Of the 819 participants who completed the marble problem (denominator neglect), 440 completed this probability matching Problem 1, and 379 completed probability matching Problem 2, to be
described next.
For this problem, students who predicted any combination of 7
“1” cards and 3 “2” cards were classified as using the MATCH
strategy (n ⫽ 184, 41.8%). Students who predicted “1” for each of
the 10 cards were classified as using the maximizing (MAX)
strategy (n ⫽ 105, 23.9%). Any other combination of card guesses
was classified as the OTHER strategy (n ⫽ 151, 34.3%). The
maximizing strategy is of course normative in this paradigm, but it
was used by only a minority of participants.

Probabilistic Reasoning: Probability Matching Versus
Maximizing
Problem 2. Adapted from West and Stanovich (2003; see also
Gal & Baron, 1996), this problem read as follows:
Consider the following situation: A die with 4 red faces and 2 green
faces will be rolled 6 times. Before each roll you will be asked to
predict which color (red or green) will show up once the die is rolled.

STANOVICH AND WEST

684

Which color is most likely to show up after roll #1? (1 ⫽ red or 2 ⫽
green); Which color is most likely to show up after roll #2? (1 ⫽ red
or 2 ⫽ green); . . . Which color is most likely to show up after roll #6?
(1 ⫽ red or 2 ⫽ green).

For this problem, students who chose any combination of 4 “red”
faces and 2 “green” faces were classified as using the MATCH
strategy (n ⫽ 173, 45.6%). Students who chose “red” for each of
the six rolls were classified as using the MAX strategy (n ⫽ 130,
34.3%). Any other combination of color choices was classified as
the OTHER strategy (n ⫽ 76, 20.1%).
Table 6 displays the mean SAT score for each of the response
groups for probabilistic reasoning Problems 1 and 2. For Problem
1, there was a significant overall effect of group, F(2, 437) ⫽
16.55, MSE ⫽ 10,126, p ⬍ .001, ␩2p ⫽ .070. The mean SAT score
for the MAX group was significantly higher than the mean SAT
score for both the MATCH group and the OTHER group. The
point biserial correlation between responding normatively (MAX)
versus nonnormatively (MATCH or OTHER) and SAT total score
was .262 ( p ⬍ .001).
The results for probabilistic reasoning Problem 2 were exactly
parallel. There was a significant overall effect of group, F(2,
376) ⫽ 14.85, MSE ⫽ 10,662, p ⬍ .001, ␩2p ⫽ .073. The mean
SAT score for the MAX group was significantly higher than the
mean SAT score for both the MATCH group and the OTHER
group. The point biserial correlation between responding normatively (MAX) versus nonnormatively (MATCH or OTHER) and
SAT total score was .270 ( p ⬍ .001). Like denominator neglect,
the tendency to maximize predictive accuracy in this probabilistic
reasoning task was related to cognitive ability.

problems—the inconsistent syllogisms—were worded such that
the validity judgment was in conflict with the believability of the
conclusion (e.g., All flowers have petals; roses have petals; therefore, roses are flowers–which is invalid). Eight of the problems—
the consistent syllogisms—were worded such that the validity
judgment was congruent with the believability of the conclusion
(e.g., All fish can swim; tuna are fish; therefore, tuna can swim—
which is valid). Eight of the problems—representing the neutral
condition—involved imaginary content (e.g., All opprobines run
on electricity; Jamtops run on electricity; therefore, Jamtops are
opprobines–which is invalid) and were thus neither consistent nor
inconsistent. Participants were instructed to judge the validity of
the conclusion assuming that all of the premises were true.
A belief bias effect was demonstrated on the syllogistic reasoning task. The mean number of items answered correctly (out of 8)
was 6.80 (SD ⫽ 1.27) in the consistent condition, 6.73 (SD ⫽ 1.38)
in the neutral condition, and 5.11 (SD ⫽ 1.91) in the inconsistent
condition. Participants answered significantly more consistent
items than inconsistent items, t(435) ⫽ 18.06, p ⬍ .001. Cognitive
ability was significantly correlated with the magnitude of belief
bias (number of consistent items correct minus number of inconsistent items correct) displayed by each participant (r ⫽ ⫺.28, p ⬍
.001). Regarding the individual conditions separately, cognitive
ability correlated significantly ( p ⬍ .001) with the number of
consistent items correct (r ⫽ .25), the number of neutral items
correct (r ⫽ .39), and the number of inconsistent items correct (r ⫽
.45). Cognitive ability correlated more highly with the inconsistent
items than with the consistent items (test for difference between
dependent correlations), t(433) ⫽ 4.07, p ⬍ .001.

Belief Bias: Syllogisms

Belief Bias: Deductive Certainty of Modus Ponens

Belief bias occurs when people have difficulty evaluating conclusions that conflict with what they think they know about the
world (Evans, 2002; Evans, Barston, & Pollard, 1983; Evans,
Newstead, Allen, & Pollard, 1994; Klauer, Musch, & Naumer,
2000). It is most often assessed with syllogistic reasoning tasks in
which the believability of the conclusion conflicts with logical
validity.
Twenty-four syllogistic reasoning problems, largely drawn from
Markovits and Nantel (1989), were completed by the participants.
The 436 participants for this task (127 men and 309 women) were
recruited in the same manner as in all the previous studies, but
none had participated in previous experiments. Their mean reported total SAT score was 1174 (SD ⫽ 109). Eight of the

The 381 participants for this task (94 men and 287 women) were
recruited in the same manner as in all the previous studies, but
none had participated in previous experiments. Their mean reported total SAT score was 1174 (SD ⫽ 109). This task was
adapted from a study by George (1995). It is a deductive reasoning
task that assesses whether participants recognize the deductive
certainty of modus ponens. Participants read four arguments. Following is one example:
Premises: 1. If there is a postal strike, then unemployment will double.
2. There is a postal strike. Conclusion: 3. Unemployment will double.

Participants responded on the following scale: true (7), probably
true (6), somewhat true (5), uncertain (4), somewhat false (3),

probably false (2), and false (1). Premise 1 in the other three
arguments was as follows: “If the winter is harsh, then there will
be a flu epidemic,” “If a car is a Honda, then it is expensive,” “If
a person eats hamburgers, then he/she will get cancer.” The score
on the task was the sum of the responses to all four items. Because
the normatively correct answer on each item is “true,” normatively
correct responding on the task should result in a score of 28.
Belief bias was shown on at least one of the modus ponens
problems by 222 participants (they were less than certain that the
syllogism was true on at least one problem). In contrast, 159
participants displayed no-belief bias on this task—they answered
true to each of the four items. The mean SAT score of the no-belief
bias group (1196, SD ⫽ 105) was significantly higher than the
mean SAT score (1164, SD ⫽ 106) of the participants who
displayed some degree of belief bias, t(379) ⫽ 2.91, p ⬍ .01,
Cohen’s d ⫽ 0.302. A parallel, continuous analysis was conducted
in which the score on each of four items (true ⫽ 7, probably
true ⫽ 6, etc.) was summed to yield a total score on the modus
ponens belief bias items. The correlation between this index and
the SAT total score was .19 ( p ⬍ .001).

Four-Card Selection Task
Participants who completed this task were 375 of the participants who completed the modus ponens task. Originally used by
Wason (1966), the abstract version of the selection task has been
studied extensively in the deductive reasoning literature (for detailed discussions of the enormous literature on the task, see Evans,
Newstead, & Byrne, 1993; Evans & Over, 1996, 2004; Sperber,
Cara, & Girotto, 1995; Stanovich & West, 1998a). The problem
involves reasoning about the falsifiability of an “if P then Q” type
of rule. We used a version with features that facilitated performance: “violation” instructions, requiring justifications for each of
the choices, and using a form of the rule that discourages a
biconditional interpretation (see Platt & Griggs, 1993, 1995).
The correct response is to choose the P and not-Q cards. We
specifically examined the common response patterns that have
been discussed in the literature: P-only, PQ, all of the cards, and
PQ not-Q. All remaining response patterns were classified as
Other. We also constructed the “logic index” employed by Pollard
and Evans (1987). It is formed by subtracting the number of
incorrect responses (not-P and Q) from the number of correct
responses (P and not-Q).
The major response patterns on the four-card selection task and
the mean SAT score associated with that pattern are displayed in
Table 7. Because this version of the task contained several features
that have been found to facilitate performance in past studies (Platt
& Griggs, 1993, 1995), the solution rate (30.9%) was substantially
higher than that usually obtained with the abstract selection task
(often 10% or less). Cognitive ability was associated with the
response given to this version of selection task. In a one-way
ANOVA, there was a significant overall effect of group, F(5,
369) ⫽ 8.22, MSE ⫽ 10,213, p ⬍ .001, ␩2p ⫽ .100. Partitioning the
sample somewhat differently, we found that the mean SAT score
(1214, SD ⫽ 96) of the group answering correctly was significantly higher than the mean SAT score (1163, SD ⫽ 106) of those
giving an incorrect answer, t(373) ⫽ 4.40, p ⬍ .001, Cohen’s d ⫽
0.493. Finally, there was a statistically significant correlation between the logic index score for the task and the SAT total score
(r ⫽ .292, p ⬍ .001). Thus, all of the analyses of this task
consistently pointed to an association between cognitive ability
and selection task performance.

Informal Reasoning: Argument Evaluation Test
The same participants who completed the previous task also
were given the Argument Evaluation Test (AET; for details, see
Stanovich & West, 1997). The test consists of two parts. First,
participants indicated their degree of agreement with a series of 23
target propositions (on topics such as gun control, taxes, university
governance, crime, etc.) on a 4-point scale. Participants then
evaluated arguments (which varied on an operationally defined
measure of strength; see Stanovich & West, 1997) relevant to these
propositions. Individual differences in participants’ reliance on
objective argument quality were examined by running separate
regression analyses on each participant’s responses. Each participant’s 23 argument evaluation responses were regressed simultaneously on both the 23 argument quality scores and the 23 prior
opinion scores. The former beta weight was used as the primary
indicator of the ability to evaluate arguments independently of
their prior opinion on the issue in question.
Performance on the AET was evaluated by examining the beta
weight for argument quality for each participant. This score ranged
from ⫺.506 to .768 and displayed a mean of .296 (SD ⫽ .215).
This beta weight was greater than zero for 90.9% of the sample.
The beta weight for argument quality was significantly correlated
with the SAT total score (r ⫽ .353, p ⬍ .001), indicating that

The studies reported here demonstrated that many biases discussed in the heuristics and biases literature are surprisingly independent of cognitive ability in the range examined in our experiments. We say surprisingly because ever since Spearman (1904)
first discovered positive manifold, intelligence indicators have
correlated with a plethora of cognitive abilities and thinking skills
that are almost too large to enumerate (e.g., Ackerman, Kyllonen,
& Richards, 1999; Carroll, 1993; Deary, 2000, 2001; Lubinski,
2000, 2004; Lubinski & Humphreys, 1997; Sternberg, 1977,
2000). Of course, the generalization of our results must be restricted to the range of cognitive ability contained in our sample.
All of our studies employed university students as participants.
The higher and lower SAT groupings are partitionings of the upper
half and lower half of the sample—the low-SAT group is not low
in an absolute sense; they simply are of lower cognitive ability
relative to their counterparts in that particular study. The magnitude of the correlations involving SAT obtained in these studies is
undoubtedly attenuated because of restriction of range. However,
the fact that the range of the samples studied is somewhat restricted makes many of the findings (of near zero correlations
between cognitive ability and many aspects of rational thought) no
less startling. It is quite unexpected that, across even the range of
ability in a university population, there would be so little relation
between rational thought and cognitive ability.

Mindware Gaps and Override Detection
Of course, it is not true that all thinking biases are independent
of cognitive ability. The right column of Table 8 lists some effects
and biases from Experiment 8 and from other studies where an
association was found. Kahneman (2000) offers the beginning of
an explanation of why certain rational thinking tasks might show
associations with cognitive ability and others may not. His argument begins with the distinction between coherence rationality and
reasoning rationality. Reasoning rationality “requires an ability to
reason correctly about the information currently at hand without

demanding perfect consistency among beliefs that are not simultaneously evoked” (Kahneman & Frederick, 2005, p. 277). In
contrast, “coherence is much stricter . . . coherence requires
choices and beliefs to be immune to variations of framing and
context. This is a lot to ask for, but an inability to pass betweensubjects tests of coherence is indeed a significant flaw” (Kahneman, 2000, p. 682). Kahneman and Frederick (2002; see Kahneman, 2000), utilizing a dual-process framework, argued that
correlations with cognitive ability will occur only in the intermediate range of difficulty. There, they argued, “intelligent people are
more likely to possess the relevant logical rules and also to
recognize the applicability of these rules in particular situations. In
the terms of the present analysis, high-IQ respondents benefit from
relatively efficient System 2 operations that enable them to overcome erroneous intuitions when adequate information is available.
When a problem is too difficult for everyone, however, the correlation is likely to reverse” (Kahneman & Frederick, 2002, p. 68).
The phrase “possess the relevant logical rules and also to recognize the applicability of these rules in particular situations”
suggests two conditions that have to be fulfilled for a heuristically
based response to be overridden by analytic processing (Evans,
2003, 2006, 2007; Kahneman & Frederick, 2002; Stanovich,
1999). These two conditions are actually the two sources of judgmental error that Kahneman and Tversky (1982a), two-decades
ago, labeled as errors of application and errors of comprehension.
The latter refers to errors that occur because people do not recognize the validity of a norm that they have violated. The former
occurs when a person fails to apply a rule that he or she has
learned.
In the remainder of this article, we use two slightly different
terms for the loci of these problems. An error of comprehension we
call a mindware gap (Stanovich, 2008a, 2008b; Toplak, Liu,
Macpherson, Toneatto, & Stanovich, 2007). This is because in
dual-process models, an important function of the analytic system
is to take early representations triggered by the heuristic system
offline and to substitute better responses. Mindware, a term coined
by Perkins (1995; Clark, 2001, uses it in a slightly different way

THINKING BIASES

from Perkins’ original coinage), refers to the rules, procedures, and
strategies that can be retrieved by the analytic system and used to
substitute for the heuristic response. However, if the mindware
available to the analytic system for heuristic override has not been
learned, then we have a case of a mindware gap.
In contrast, errors of application can only occur when the
relevant mindware has been learned and is available for use in the
override process. Errors of application occur when people fail to
detect the situational cues indicating that the heuristically primed
response needs to be overridden and an analytically derived response substituted. We give this requirement the label override
detection (detecting the necessity for heuristic override). The
above quote from Kahneman and Frederick (2002) suggests that
cognitive ability differences only arise when the experimental task
allows for variation in the presence of the relevant mindware and
in the override detection process. It will be argued here that this
analysis ignores a third potent source of nonnormative responding
that might be an even more important source of individual differences.

A Framework for Individual Differences in Heuristics and
Biases Tasks
Most of the tasks in the heuristics and biases literature were
deliberately designed to pit a heuristically triggered response
against a normative response generated by the analytic system. As
Kahneman (2000) noted, “Tversky and I always thought of the
heuristics and biases approach as a two-process theory” (p. 682).
However, what this means is that even after the necessity for
override has been detected and the relevant mindware is available,
the conflict has to be resolved. Resolving the conflict in favor of
the analytic response may require cognitive capacity, especially if
cognitive decoupling must take place for a considerable period of
time while the analytic response is computed. Cognitive decoupling is involved in inhibiting the heuristic response and also in
simulating alternative responses (Stanovich, 2008a, 2008b). Recent work on inhibition and executive functioning has indicated
that such cognitive decoupling is very capacity demanding and that
it is strongly related to individual differences in fluid intelligence
(Duncan, Emslie, Williams, Johnson, & Freer, 1996; Engle, 2002;
Geary, 2005; Gray, Chabris, & Braver, 2003; Kane & Engle, 2002,
2003; Salthouse, Atkinson, & Berish, 2003; Unsworth & Engle,
2005, 2007).
It is argued here that it is this third factor present in some
heuristics and biases tasks—the necessity for sustained cognitive
decoupling—that is the major source of the variability in the
association between cognitive ability and task performance that is
displayed in Table 8. Building on the conjectures of Kahneman
(2000) and Kahneman and Frederick (2002), our framework for
conceptualizing individual differences on heuristics and biases
tasks is displayed in Figure 1. The question addressed in the first
stage of the framework is whether, for a given task, the mindware
is available to carry out override (whether the procedures and
declarative knowledge are available to substitute an analytic response for a heuristic one). If the relevant mindware is not available, then the person must, of necessity, respond heuristically. It is
immaterial whether the person detects the necessity for override or
has the capacity to sustain override if the normatively appropriate
response is simply not available. If the relevant mindware (prob-

abilistic thinking skills, falsifiability tendencies, disposition to
search for alternative explanations, sensitivity to contradiction,
etc.) is not present, then participants will end up at what has been
termed in the figure Path 1 to a heuristic response.
If the relevant mindware is in fact available, then the next
question that becomes operative is whether or not the person
detects the need to override the heuristic response. Even if the
relevant mindware is present, if the participant does not detect any
reason to override the heuristic response, then it will be emitted
(this is Path 2 to a heuristic response as labeled in the figure).
Many heuristics and biases tasks lead people down this path.
People do not detect the need to override the response that comes
naturally (Kahneman, 2003) even though, in retrospect, they would
endorse the norm that the heuristic response violated (Kahneman
& Tversky, 1982a; Shafir, 1998; Shafir & Tversky, 1995; Thaler,
1987).
The next choice point in the figure concerns the task rather than
the participant. If the relevant mindware is present and if the need
for override has been noted, the question then becomes whether or
not the task requires sustained inhibition (cognitive decoupling) in
order to carry out the override of the heuristic response. If not (or
if the capacity required is low—this of course may not be an
all-or-nothing issue), then the analytic (System 2) response will be
substituted for the heuristic response. In contrast, if the task
requires sustained decoupling in order to carry out override, then
we must ask whether the participant has the cognitive capacity that
will be necessary. If so, then the analytic response will be given.
If not, then the heuristic response will be given (Path 3 to the
heuristic response in the figure)— despite the availability of the
relevant mindware and the recognition of the need to use it.
In order for cognitive ability to associate with a bias, there must
be differences correlated with cognitive ability at some of the
choice points in the framework—that is, in some of the person

688

parameters that branch toward or away from heuristic paths. As
Kahneman (2000) noted, “A task will be too difficult if (1) System
1 favors an incorrect answer, and (2) System 2 is incapable of
applying the correct rule, either because the rule is unknown
[mindware gap] or because the cues that would evoke it are absent
[no override detection]” (p. 682). Performance on such a task will
be floored and will show no association with cognitive ability.
Some of the tasks in Table 8 are no doubt of this type (betweensubjects conjunction effects, for example). However, several of the
tasks in Table 8 without associations with cognitive ability cannot
be viewed as displaying floor effects.2 For a cognitive ability
difference to be observed, there must be differential cleaving by
intelligence at some of the critical nodes in Figure 1—that is, there
must be a correlation between intelligence and at least one of the
person parameters. Of course, the partitioning of cognitive ability
groups at each of the nodes will vary from task to task. We
advance here a generic conjecture about the source of associations
with cognitive ability. The conjecture is that the primary source of
associations with cognitive ability in heuristics and biases tasks is
the way that people are partitioned by person Parameter 3 (“does
the person have the decoupling capacity to sustain override”).

Cognitive Decoupling, Mindware Gaps, and Override
Detection in Heuristics and Biases Tasks
There is evidence in the literature indicating that intelligence
tests (especially tests of fluid intelligence, see Carroll, 1993; Horn
& Cattell, 1967; Horn & Noll, 1997) directly tap the ability to
sustaining the decoupling of representations from the world so that
cognitive simulations can be run which test the outcomes of
imaginary actions (Currie & Ravenscroft, 2002; Dienes & Perner,
1999; Evans & Over, 2004; Kahneman & Tversky, 1982b; Nichols
& Stich, 2003). There is probably a substantial differential in the
cleaving at Node 3 based on cognitive ability (Duncan et al., 1996;
Kane & Engle, 2002; Salthouse et al., 2003). In contrast, we
conjecture that, for many tasks in the heuristics and biases literature, the other two parameters show only modest differential
partitioning based on cognitive ability.
Regarding Parameter 1, it is true that the rules, knowledge, and
strategies available to the analytic system to use in heuristic system
overrides are in part the product of past learning experiences. One
might expect that people with more cognitive ability would profit
more from learning experiences. However, the relevant mindware
for our present discussion is not just generic procedural knowledge, nor is it the hodge-podge of declarative knowledge that is
often used to assess crystallized intelligence on ability tests. Instead, it is a very special subset of knowledge related to how one
views probability and chance; whether one has the tools to think
scientifically and the propensity to do so; the tendency to think
logically; and knowledge of some special rules of formal reasoning
and good argumentation. At least among the university students
typically tested in these studies, acquiring these sets of skills and
knowledge bases might be, experientially, very haphazard.
Although it is true that more intelligent individuals learn more
things than the less intelligent, many thinking dispositions relevant
to rationality are acquired rather late in life and the explicit
teaching of this mindware is very spotty and inconsistent. For
example, the tendency to think of alternative explanations for a
phenomenon leads to the ability to more accurately infer causal

models of events. Such principles are taught very inconsistently
(by either explicit or implicit means). Or take, for example, the
conjunction rule of probability, the violation of which is illustrated
in the Linda problem. Kahneman and Tversky (1982a) reported
that tests of rule endorsement and argument endorsement conducted after participants had made the conjunction error revealed
that statistically sophisticated psychology graduate students did
endorse the rule they had violated (they possessed the relevant
mindware but did not detect the necessity for override). However,
a majority of statistically naı̈ve undergraduate students failed to
endorse the conjunction rule—they lacked the relevant mindware
(“much to our surprise, naive subjects did not have a solid grasp of
the conjunction rule,” p. 127, Kahneman & Tversky, 1982a). The
lack of uniform teaching and learning conditions for the acquisition of this mindware might attenuate any natural correlation with
intelligence that there would be if it were taught under uniform
conditions.
Override detection (Parameter 2), we would argue, is perhaps
even more likely to display a low correlation with cognitive ability.
First, it would seem to be more of a thinking disposition (related
to constructs like need for cognition; e.g., see Cacioppo et al.,
1996) than a cognitive capacity. Psychometricians have long distinguished typical performance situations from optimal (sometimes termed maximal) performance situations (Ackerman, 1994,
1996; Ackerman & Heggestad, 1997; Cronbach, 1949; Matthews,
Zeidner, & Roberts, 2002). Typical performance situations are
unconstrained in that no overt instructions to maximize performance are given, and the task interpretation is determined to some
extent by the participant. In contrast, optimal performance situations are those in which the task interpretation is determined
externally (not left to the participant); the participant is instructed
to maximize performance and is told how to do so. All tests of
intelligence or cognitive aptitude are optimal performance assessments, whereas measures of rational thinking dispositions (need
for cognition, actively openminded thinking, reflectivity/
impulsivity) are often assessed under typical performance conditions.
Override detection, particularly in between-subjects designs, is
exercised under typical rather than optimal conditions. It thus
parses, in terms of the structure of cognitive abilities (Baron, 1985,
2000; Dole & Sinatra, 1998; Matthews et al., 2002; Sinatra &
Pintrich, 2003; Sternberg, 1997, 2003) with thinking dispositions
rather than cognitive capacity measures such as intelligence. For
these theoretical reasons, we think that person Parameter 2 in the
framework is less the source of associations with cognitive ability
than is Parameter 3.

Although the presence of floor and ceiling effects can be difficult to
determine in between-subjects experiments, it is clear that at least some of
our between-subjects tasks avoided them. For example, in the engineer/
lawyer base-rate problem from Experiment 1, roughly half of the sample
made estimates below 60% in the 30% engineer condition, even though the
description tilts toward engineer. This seems to show some sensitivity to
the base rate and to thus indicate that at least half the sample was not
floored. It is likewise with the African countries anchoring problem of
Experiment 1. Regardless of the anchor, more than half the sample gave
estimates less than 55 and greater than 15. Given that the actual number is
53, such performance is indicative of at least some degree of resistance to
anchoring in the task.

THINKING BIASES

There are two other ways that the influence of Parameter 2, as
a generator of individual differences, becomes attenuated—
essentially by floor effects (as Kahneman, 2000, argued), but also
by ceiling effects. Certain tasks in between-subjects designs (perhaps anchoring problems or the Linda problem) give so few cues
to the possibility of heuristic/analytic conflict that this parameter is
probably floored for most subjects. Conversely, the instructions in
other tasks (belief bias assessed with syllogisms, for example), and
some situations in real life (“the salesperson is trying to sell
you— don’t forget”) are so explicit in calling attention to heuristic/
analytic conflict that this parameter is probably near ceiling.
The case of belief bias in syllogistic reasoning is probably a
good illustration of our argument that it is Parameter 3—the
decoupling capacity parameter—that is the primary generator of
associations with cognitive ability in rational thinking tasks3 (see
De Neys, 2006a, 2006b). The mindware available to reason logically on these simple categorical syllogisms (Parameter 1) is
probably pretty uniformly present in the sample of university
students studied here (and in most studies in the reasoning literature). The procedures needed to reason through the syllogisms
used in these studies (for example, the invalid syllogism: all A are
B, all C are B, therefore all C are A) are within the mindware of
the vast majority of the students in research studies (the percentage
correct in the neutral condition in Experiment 8 [84.1%] was
almost as high as the percentage correct in the consistent condition
[85.0%]). Additionally, as just mentioned, the instructions on this
task probably ceiling out Parameter 2— override detection. Recall
that the instructions to the task sensitize the participants to potential conflict (between argument validity and the truth of argument
components). Thus, Parameters 1 and 2 probably leave little room
for any individual difference variable to associate with performance.
In contrast, the task does require sustained cognitive decoupling
(De Neys, 2006b). In the “rose” syllogism for example (All flowers have petals; roses have petals; therefore, roses are flowers—
which is invalid), participants must suppress the tendency to endorse a valid response because of the “naturalness” (see
Kahneman, 2003) of the conclusion—roses are flowers. This response must be held in abeyance while reasoning procedures work
through the partially overlapping set logic indicating that the
conclusion does not necessarily follow and that the syllogism is
thus invalid. The reasoning process may take several seconds of
perhaps somewhat aversive concentration (see Botvinick, Cohen,
& Carter, 2004; Glenberg, 1997; Kahneman, 1973; Navon,
1989)—seconds during which the urge to foreclose the conflict by
acceding to the natural tendency to affirm “roses are flowers” (by
responding “valid”) must be suppressed. Such response suppression while reasoning is closely related to the inhibitory and conflict
resolution processes being studied by investigators examining the
construct of executive functioning (Baddeley, Chincotta, & Adlam, 2001; Botvinick et al., 2004; Kane, 2003; Salthouse et al.,
2003). Individual differences in such inhibitory processes have
been found to be strongly associated with individual differences in
fluid intelligence.
We conjectured that many of the other tasks that do show
associations with cognitive ability (second column of Table 8) are
tasks that involve some type of inhibition and/or sustained cognitive decoupling. For example, in within-subjects tests of outcome
bias (Stanovich & West, 1998c) the appearance of the second item

689

gives a pretty clear signal to the participant that there is an issue of
consistency in their responses to the two different forms—that is,
the within-subjects design probably puts Parameter 2 at ceiling,
thus insuring that it is not the source of any associations with
cognitive ability that are obtained. Detecting the need for consistency is not the issue. Instead, the difficulty comes from the
necessity of inhibiting the tendency to downgrade the decision in
the negative outcome condition, despite its having a better rationale than the positive outcome decision. Even in the betweensubjects version of this task, one group of participants—those
getting the negative outcome version—is alerted to the potential
conflict between the seemingly good reasons to have the operation
and the shockingly bad outcome. Participants must suppress the
desire to sanction the decision, decouple their knowledge of the
outcome, and simulate (see Evans & Over, 1996; Nichols & Stich,
2003) what they would have thought had they not known the
outcome. Indeed, this condition creates a situation similar to those
of various “curse of knowledge” paradigms (see Birch, 2005;
Camerer, Loewenstein, & Weber, 1989; Gilovich, Medvec, &
Sativsky, 1998; Hinds, 1999; Keysar & Barr, 2002; Royzman,
Cassidy, & Baron, 2003). Note that the two cognitive ability
groups show no difference in the positive outcome condition (see
Table 1), which does not necessitate heuristic system override. The
difference is entirely in the negative outcome condition in which
sustained suppression is required.
The “curse of knowledge” logic of the negative item in the
outcome bias task is similar to that in hindsight bias paradigms
(e.g., Christiansen-Szalanski & Williams, 1991; Fischhoff, 1975;
Pohl, 2004), which have also shown associations with cognitive
ability (Stanovich & West, 1998c). In hindsight paradigms, the
marking of the correct response sensitizes every respondent to the
potential conflict involved— between what you know now versus
what you would have known without the correct response being
indicated. Thus again, Parameter 2 must be at ceiling. However,
there is a need for sustained decoupling in the task, so whatever
association between bias and cognitive ability exists on the task (a
modest one; see Stanovich & West, 1998c) is likely generated by
individual differences in Parameter 3.
Within-subjects framing paradigms probably have a similar
logic. The appearance of the second problem surely signals that an
issue of consistency is at stake (putting Parameter 2 at ceiling), and
virtually all of the university students in these studies have acquired the value of consistency (Parameter 1 is also at ceiling). The
modest cognitive ability associations that are generated by this task
probably derive from lower cognitive ability participants who
cannot suppress the attractiveness of an alternative response despite the threat to consistent responding that it represents—in
short, from variation in Parameter 3. In contrast, between-subjects
framing situations probably drive Parameter 2 to a very low value
(few people recognize that there is a conflict to be resolved
between a potentially different response to an alternative framing),
3

Our conjecture here amounts to an endorsement of what Evans (in
press) calls the quality hypothesis regarding cognitive ability—that individuals higher in cognitive ability are more likely to compute the correct
response given that they have engaged System 2. The corresponding
quantity hypothesis is that individuals higher in cognitive ability are more
likely to engage System 2.

STANOVICH AND WEST

690

thus eliminating associations with individual differences (in the
manner suggested by Kahneman, 2000).
The logic of the Linda problem is similar. Transparent, withinsubjects versions are easier because they signal the conflict involved and the necessity for override. Such versions create at least
modest associations with cognitive ability. In the between-subjects
version, however, individual differences are eliminated entirely
because this design obscures the heuristic/analytic conflict and
puts Parameter 2 at floor.
As a final example, consider the difference between causal and
noncausal base rates4 illustrated in Table 8. Noncausal base-rate
problems trigger conflict detection in so few participants that
Parameter 2 is floored and hence cognitive ability differences are
eliminated. In contrast, in a classic causal base-rate problem such
as the Volvo versus Saab problem (see Footnote 4), where aggregate information is pitted against indicant information, the aggregate information has a causal relationship to the criterion behavior.
Thus, the aggregate information in causal base-rate scenarios
clearly signals that there are two pieces of information in conflict,
Parameter 2 is near ceiling, and individual differences are determined largely by Parameter 3 (the sustained decoupling parameter), which is, we conjecture, linked to individual differences in
cognitive ability. Thus, causal, but not noncausal, base-rate problems show cognitive ability differences.
Of course, with this discussion of what creates associations
between biases and cognitive ability, we do not mean to draw
attention away from the most salient outcome of this investigation—that a startlingly wide range of rational thinking tendencies
appear to be independent of intelligence within the range existing
in a university sample. These include many tasks that test some
very basic strictures of rational thought. For example, the absence
of framing and context effects are performance patterns that ensure
that people’s choices are utility maximizing. The failure to adhere
to these strictures leads to descriptive models of human rationality
that have profound public policy implications (Camerer, Issacharoff, Loewenstein, O’Donoghue, & Rabin, 2003; Mitchell, 2005;
Prentice, 2005; Sunstein & Thaler, 2003). But adherence to these
strictures of utility maximization were unrelated to cognitive ability in our sample. Within the range of intelligence that we studied,
individuals of the highest cognitive capacity were no less likely to
display base-rate neglect, the conjunction fallacy, myside bias,
anchoring effects, the sunk-cost effect, proportion dominance, and
a host of other cognitive biases.

General Conclusions
The framework in Figure 1 illustrates why rationality will not be
uniformly related to intelligence. Instead, that relationship will
depend upon the degree that rational responding requires sustained
cognitive decoupling. When the heart of the task is recognizing the
need for heuristic override but the override operation itself is easily
accomplished, no sustained decoupling is necessary and rational
thinking will depend more on the operations of the reflective mind
than on those of the algorithmic mind (Stanovich, 2008a, 2008b).
Thus, relationships with intelligence will be attenuated. Additionally, as Kahneman (2000) has argued, when detecting the necessity
for override is very difficult (Parameter 2 is low), performance
overall will be quite low and no relationships with cognitive ability
will be evident.

Conversely, however, highly intelligent people will display
fewer reasoning biases when you tell them what the bias is and
what they need to do to avoid it. That is, when Parameters 1 and
2 are ceilinged and considerable cognitive capacity is needed to
sustain decoupling while the correct response is computed, then
highly intelligent people will do better in a rational thinking task.
However, if there is no advance warning that biased processing
must be avoided (as is the case in many between-subjects designs),
then more intelligent individuals are not much more likely to
perform any better on the task. Another way to phrase this is to say
that, often, people of higher cognitive ability are no more likely to
recognize the need for a normative principle than are individuals of
lower cognitive ability. When the former believe that nothing
normative is at stake, they behave remarkably like other people
(equally likely for example to be “anchored” into responding that
redwoods are almost 1,000 ft tall!—see Table 1). If told, however,
that they are in a situation of normative conflict and if resolving
the conflict requires holding a prepotent response in abeyance,
then the individual of high cognitive ability will show less of many
different cognitive biases.
An important caveat to the model presented in Figure 1 is that
which rational thinking tasks yield a conflict between heuristic and
analytic responses is not fixed, but instead is a function of the
individual’s history of mindware acquisition. Early in developmental history, the relevant mindware will not be present and the
heuristic response will be inevitable—no conflict will even be
detected. Someone with no training in thinking probabilistically—
or, for that matter, logically in terms of subset and superset—may
experience no conflict in the Linda problem. As experience with
statistical and probabilistic thinking grows, a person will begin to
experience more of a conflict because relevant mindware is available for use in the simulation of an alternative response by the
analytic system. The final developmental stage in this sequence
might well be that the mindware used in analytic simulation
becomes so tightly compiled that it is triggered in the manner of a
natural heuristic response. Some statistics instructors, for example,
become unable to empathize with their students for whom the
basic probability axioms are not transparent. The instructor can no
longer remember when these axioms were not primary intuitions.
This final stage of processing is perhaps captured by developmental models of heuristic versus analytic processing that trace a
trajectory where fluent adult performance looks very heuristic
(Brainerd & Reyna, 2001; Ericsson & Charness, 1994; Klein,
1998; Reyna, 2004; Reyna & Brainerd, 1995; Reyna, Lloyd, &
Brainerd, 2003).

Base rates that have a causal relationship to the criterion behavior
(Ajzen, 1977; Bar-Hillel, 1980, 1990; Tversky & Kahneman, 1979) are
often distinguished from noncausal base-rate problems—those involving
base rates with no obvious causal relationship to the criterion behavior. A
famous noncausal problem is the well-known cab problem (see Bar-Hillel,
1980; Lyon & Slovic, 1976; Tversky & Kahneman, 1982). In contrast, the
classic Volvo versus Saab item (see p. 285 of Fong, Krantz, & Nisbett,
1986) would be an example of a causal base-rate problem.
