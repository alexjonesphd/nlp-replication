Although many accounts of task switching emphasize the importance of working memory as a substantial
source of the switch cost, there is a lack of evidence demonstrating that task switching actually places
additional demands on working memory. The present study addressed this issue by implementing task
switching in continuous complex span tasks with strictly controlled time parameters. A series of 4
experiments demonstrate that recall performance decreased as a function of the number of task switches
and that the concurrent load of item maintenance had no influence on task switching. These results
indicate that task switching induces a cost on working memory functioning. Implications for theories of
task switching, working memory, and resource sharing are addressed.

ory functioning and more precisely the effect of task switching on
concurrent maintenance of information within working memory.

An important aspect of cognitive control is our capability to
flexibly allocate attention to several activities at the same time and
to swiftly reallocate attention from one activity to another in a
minimum of time. Although we can think of daily examples
reflecting this flexibility (e.g., writing an article and switching
attention to a telephone call, Monsell, 2003), performance during
task switching is inferior compared with the performance during
task repetition. Indeed, task switching is associated with longer
latencies and higher error rates, which is known as the task switch
cost (Allport, Styles, & Hsieh, 1994; Jersild, 1927; Meiran, 1996;
Rogers & Monsell, 1995).
While the effect of task switching on general performance
measures has been extensively studied, the impact of task switching on working memory functioning remains underspecified. This
is a rather surprising state of affairs because, on the one hand,
several accounts of task switching have postulated working memory processes as the main source of the switch cost (e.g., Baddeley,
Chincotta, & Adlam, 2001; Emerson & Miyake, 2003; Mayr &
Kliegl, 2000, 2003; Rubinstein, Meyer, & Evans, 2001), and on the
other hand, switching is supposed to be a key process within
working memory functioning (Barrouillet, Bernardin, & Camos,
2004; Cowan, 2005). Accordingly, the aim of the present study
was to investigate the impact of task switching on working mem-

Task Set Reconfiguration and Task Switching
The view of working memory functioning as the main source of
the switch cost is mainly endorsed by accounts emphasizing the
role of control processes in task switching. More specifically,
working memory would be involved in the configuration and the
maintenance of the different task settings needed to perform an
upcoming task (i.e., task set reconfiguration; Rogers & Monsell,
1995). For instance, some authors proposed that only one task set
can be present at the same time in working memory and that, in
order to switch between two tasks, the relevant task set must be
retrieved from long-term memory by means of executive processes
and subsequently maintained in working memory (e.g., Mayr &
Kliegl, 2000, 2003; Rubinstein et al., 2001), while the irrelevant
task set is no longer active (Koch & Philipp, 2005; Schuch &
Koch, 2003; Verbruggen, Liefooghe, Szmalec, & Vandierendonck,
2005; Verbruggen, Liefooghe, & Vandierendonck, 2006).
More direct evidence demonstrating such involvement of working memory and executive processes in task switching was reported by Baddeley et al. (2001). In a series of experiments based
on the list-completion procedure (Jersild, 1927), both a verbal
variant of the trials task and random letter generation interfered
more with mixed lists with two tasks requiring switching than with
the pure lists containing only one task and requiring no switching.
As these secondary tasks typically involve executive control processes, these findings demonstrate that the central executive is
involved in task switching. It has also been shown that the phonological loop is involved in the retrieval and maintenance of task
sets (Emerson & Miyake, 2003; Liefooghe, Vandierendonck,
Muyllaert, Verbruggen, & Vanneste, 2005; Miyake, Emerson,
Padilla, & Ahn, 2004; Saeki & Saito, 2004a, 2004b) as well as in
tracking sequential action plans (Bryck & Mayr, 2005). These

WORKING MEMORY COSTS OF TASK SWITCHING

accounts thus converge on the assumption that working memory
mediates task set reconfiguration (e.g., Mayr & Kliegl, 2000, 2003;
Rubinstein et al., 2001).
Even though the view of working memory functioning as being
an essential source of the switch cost has been frequently endorsed,
its involvement in task switching has also been questioned. First,
recent studies challenged the view that working memory is involved in the maintenance of task sets. More specifically, it has
been suggested that task elements such as response codes are
represented in the activated part of long-term memory rather than
in working memory itself (e.g., Kiesel, Wendt, & Peters, 2007;
Meiran & Kessler, 2008; Rubin & Meiran, 2005). Second, and
more importantly, while accounts calling upon task set reconfiguration are prominent, it is not univocally accepted that such processes are necessary to explain switch costs. It has been demonstrated that switch costs also substantially issue from priming
effects, which facilitate task repetition and interfere with task
switching. Such priming effects are elicited by associations between tasks, stimuli, and responses (Allport & Wylie, 2000;
Waszak, Hommel, & Allport, 2003, 2004, 2005; Wylie & Allport,
2000) or by the repetition of instructional cues indicating the task
to be performed (Arrington & Logan, 2004; Logan & Bundesen,
2003, 2004; D. W. Schneider & Logan, 2005). However, although
these priming accounts challenge the necessity of task set reconfiguration—and by consequence the involvement of working
memory in such reconfiguration—they still recognize a more
generic contribution of executive control during task switching
(e.g., Allport & Wylie, 1999). On the one hand, it has been argued
that switch costs cannot be explained only in terms of task set
priming and that they probably arise from the interaction between
task set priming and executive control processes (e.g., Gilbert &
Shallice, 2002; Yeung & Monsell, 2003). For instance, Yeung and
Monsell (2003) suggested that task set priming is influenced by
top-down control biases, which ensure that the correct task is
executed. On the other hand, D. W. Schneider and Logan (2005)
suggested that while executive control may not be required on a
trial-to-trial basis during task switching, it is still needed to set the
cognitive system in a way that enables performance during task
switching without frequent top-down intervention.
In sum, switch costs can be explained with and without task set
reconfiguration, or even through the combination of both views in
the assumption that switch costs consist of several components
with each component having a different source (e.g., Meiran,
Chorev, & Sapir, 2000; Monsell, 2003). Moreover, as we have
seen, working memory related processes can play a role in these
different views, albeit in a varying degree of importance. The
question is thus not whether working memory is involved in task
switching or not, but to what extent working memory is involved
in task switching.

Task Switching and Working Memory
Logan (2004) addressed this issue by testing the hypothesis that
working memory and task switching share a single common set of
resources. To that end, the task span procedure was used (Logan,
2004, 2006, 2007; D. W. Schneider & Logan, 2006). This procedure consists of two parts. In a first step, the study phase, participants have to memorize a series of task names such as Hi–Low
(indicating a magnitude judgment, is the number greater than or

479

less than 5?), Odd–Even (indicating a parity judgment, is the
number odd or even?), or Digit–Word (indicating a form judgment,
is the number a digit or a word?). In the second step, the test phase,
a list of targets (a series of digits) is presented. This digit series is
of the same length as the corresponding series of task names
presented in the study phase. Logan (2004) compared three conditions. In the perform condition, for each digit in the target list,
the corresponding task had to be performed by retrieving the task
name from the memorized list and applying it to the presented
digit. On the basis of this performance, the task span (i.e., the
maximum number of correctly remembered and executed tasks)
was calculated. In the recall condition, participants recalled the
names of the corresponding tasks without applying them to the
target stimulus (memory span for task names). In the control
condition, participants performed the same task throughout the list
of targets in the absence of a memory load. The primary finding of
this research is that task spans and memory spans were equal.
Importantly, conditions in which task names required task switching after every target stimulus (e.g., Hi–Low, Odd–Even, Hi–Low,
Odd–Even, Hi–Low, Odd–Even) and conditions requiring only one
task switch (i.e., Hi–Low, Hi–Low, Hi–Low, Odd–Even, Odd–
Even, Odd–Even) yielded the same span. The latter results clearly
suggest that task switching, operationalized as the number of task
switches made, has no impact on working memory functioning,
and Logan (2004) suggested that task switching and working
memory maintenance do not share a single set of resources.
More recently, Kane, Conway, Hambrick, and Engle (2007)
have reported several studies in which they investigated the connection between working memory capacity and switch costs. Although their “executive attention” theory of working memory
capacity predicts such a connection (Engle, Kane, & Tuholski,
1999), they failed in four successive experiments to find any
significant difference in switch costs between high- and low-span
participants. The authors explained this unexpected result by suggesting that task set switching may not be the executive measure it
is widely assumed to be, and they endorsed the aforementioned
accounts, which claim that switch costs result from priming effects
rather than from task set reconfiguration (e.g., Allport & Wylie,
2000; Logan & Bundesen, 2003). Thus, working memory capacity
would not have any impact on switch cost because most task
switching paradigms do not tap volitional, executive control processes.
These findings are corroborated by many correlational studies.
Some of these studies reported a clear relation between task
switching and working memory. Lehto (1996) reported fairly high
correlations between performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting
Test (Berg, 1948)— often assumed to be a test of switching between task settings—and performance on complex span tasks such
as the reading span task (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980) and the
operation span task (Turner & Engle, 1989). However, Miyake et
al. (2000) observed that the latent variable underpinning different
measures of task switching was not related to the latent variable
underlying the performance on complex span tasks. Additionally,
Friedman et al. (2006) found no significant relation between task
switching and measures of fluid intelligence, whereas there are
well-known relations between fluid intelligence and working
memory (Engle, Tuholski, Laughlin, & Conway, 1999). Thus,
most of the correlational studies equally suggest an independence
between task switching and working memory.

Dual-Task Paradigms and Time Control
The above section offers a rather pessimistic perspective with
respect to the possible impact of task switching on working memory functioning. However, such a conclusion is highly surprising.
Of course, it could be assumed that task switching does not
interfere with storage, either because task switching does not call
upon working memory resources in a sufficient way (Kane et al.,
2007) or because task switching and storage tax different resources
(Logan, 2004). This latter view implies (a) the rejection of unitary
conceptions of working memory that assume a unique resource
shared between processing and storage, and (b) the adoption of a
multicomponent view in which processing and storage rely on
separate resources and supplies. However, the process of switching
is an essential property of executive functioning (Collette & Van
der Linden, 2002; Miyake et al., 2000), being referred to as the
“gold-standard measure of executive control” (Kane et al., 2007, p.
35). It is thus difficult to imagine that switching could occur
without central executive involvement. As a consequence, even
within the multicomponent view of working memory, task switching should at least interfere with those working memory activities
implicating the central executive. For example, the processes underpinning the completion of complex span tasks (performing a
secondary task while maintaining items to be recalled) are known
to involve the central executive, and the ensuing spans—like
reading, counting, or operation spans—are usually considered as
central executive measures. It can be noted that the task span
procedure is akin to a complex span task (maintaining a list of
tasks while performing them), and it is thus puzzling that the
results issuing from this procedure did not indicate any effect of
switching on performance.
One reason for this finding could reside in the procedure used.
The clearest evidence for a direct relation between working memory and switching relies upon studies using selective interference
procedures (e.g., Baddeley et al., 2001; Emerson & Miyake, 2003;
Liefooghe et al., 2005). A common feature of such studies is the
demand to perform primary and secondary tasks at virtually the
same time. For instance, when Baddeley et al. (2001) combined
task switching with a letter span, the participants had to encode one
letter every second. In Emerson and Miyake (2003), participants
had to make articulations every 500 or 750 ms. These constraints
may create a tight temporal window in which the primary and the
secondary tasks are forced to compete with each other, necessitating control and coordination by the central executive. Alternatively, if there are no strong temporal constraints, participants can
engage in each step at their own pace and there is less need for
competition because there is more time to delay some aspects of
one task in order to process another task.
The importance of temporal constraints in examining the coordination of the processing and the maintenance of information has
recently been stressed by Barrouillet and colleagues, who created
computer-paced continuous span tasks in which time parameters
are carefully controlled (Barrouillet et al., 2004; Lépine, Bernardin, & Barrouillet, 2005). This procedure revealed that even fairly
simple tasks performed under temporal constraints could have a
highly disruptive effect on concurrent maintenance (Lépine et al.,
2005).
Barrouillet et al. (2004) accounted for these phenomena by
proposing the time-based resource-sharing model, which suggests

a unitary view of working memory. This model assumes that both
processing and maintenance of information within working memory require attention, a limited resource that must be shared. Those
items of knowledge that are inside the focus of attention receive
activation, but when attention is switched away, their activation
suffers from a time-related decay. These memory traces can be
refreshed through a covert retrieval process that requires attention
(Cowan, 1995; Cowan et al., 1994). However, following Pashler
(1998), it is assumed that there is a central bottleneck that constrains central processes and that attention can be allocated to only
one thing at a time (Garavan, 1998; Oberauer, 2003). As a consequence, attention must be switched away from processing to refresh the decaying memory traces of the information to be maintained. Barrouillet et al. assume that this attentional switching
occurs throughout processing, attention being frequently diverted
for short pauses during which other items can be focused upon and
memory traces refreshed. In other words, there is a time-based
resource sharing through a frequent and rapid switching of attention from processing to storage. In this account, any activity that
occupies attention would have a detrimental effect on storage
because it impedes, at least for short periods of time, the refreshment of the decaying memory traces. More precisely, if we define
the cognitive cost of a given activity as the detrimental effect it has
on other activities to be concurrently performed, cognitive cost
corresponds to the proportion of time during which this activity
occupies attention and impedes other activities. By comparing
continuous span tasks, which involve different processing tasks
presented at the same computer-controlled rate, we can investigate
the detrimental effect that cognitive processes have on working
memory storage (Barrouillet et al., 2004; Barrouillet, Bernardin,
Portrat, Vergauwe, & Camos, 2007; Gavens & Barrouillet, 2004;
Lépine et al., 2005). The differences in recall performance offer a
measure of the cognitive cost that investigated processes place on
working memory. Thus, the present study took advantage of the
continuous span task procedure to assess the cognitive cost of task
switching.

The Present Study
In the present article, we report on a series of four experiments
in which the relationship between task switching and working
memory was investigated. More precisely, the cognitive load of
task switching was examined by incorporating task switching in a
continuous span task. In each experiment, participants were presented with time-constrained tasks in which they had to switch
between two digit judgments while remembering letters. The question was raised whether the number of switches impaired the
concurrent maintenance of items. In Experiment 1, we compared
recall performance from continuous span tasks in which participants had either to apply the same task to each target (e.g., either
a magnitude or a parity judgment) or to systematically alternate
between the two tasks. Experiment 2 evaluated more precisely the
effect of task switching. Participants had to switch between the two
tasks in both conditions, but one condition involved only a few
task switches whereas the other condition involved a lot of task
switches. In Experiment 3, the results of Experiment 2 were
generalized to a preload procedure (Sternberg, 1967). Finally,
Experiment 4 tested the hypothesis that the effect of task switching
on storage is commensurate with the time during which task

WORKING MEMORY COSTS OF TASK SWITCHING

switching occupies attention. For this purpose, we compared the
effect of task switching on storage to the effect of stimulus degradation, which is equally attention demanding but independent of
task switching (e.g., Rubinstein et al., 2001).
As we have seen, many accounts evoked above do not predict
any effect of task switching on maintenance. By contrast, following the unitary conception of working memory and the time-based
resource-sharing model, we expected a clear impairment of task
switching on working memory storage. Because task switching
requires attention that is no longer available for refreshing decaying memory traces, the extra time of attentional occupation it
induces would thus impair the maintenance of the to-be-recalled
items. As a consequence, in all experiments, we predicted that
recall would be poorer when more task switches were required.

Experiment 1
Experiment 1 was based on the list-completion procedure (e.g.,
Allport et al., 1994; Jersild, 1927). In this procedure three types of
lists are presented: (a) a pure list containing only Task A, (b) a pure
list containing only Task B, and (c) a mixed list in which participants have to alternate between Task A and Task B. The switch
cost is computed as the difference between the mean latencies (and
error rates) of both pure lists and the mixed list. Although this
method has proven to be useful in many investigations of task
switching (e.g., Baddeley et al., 2001; Emerson & Miyake, 2003;
Saeki & Saito, 2004a, 2004b), it is important to note that the cost
observed in this situation does reflect a broad range of demands
and processes that are not all specific to task switching. For this
reason, it is more appropriate to refer to this cost as a global
switching cost (e.g., Kray & Lindenberger, 2000; Mayr, 2001). An
advantage of this method is that the difference between pure and
mixed lists is large and robust. In view of the present purpose,
namely finding evidence for an effect of task switching on working
memory storage, it seems appropriate to start with such a large
effect. If no difference is observed under these conditions, the
search for a cognitive cost associated with more fine grained
measures of task switching is futile.
The present experiment compared recall performance in continuous span tasks including either pure lists or mixed lists of tasks.
Participants were presented with a number of consonants to be
remembered. After each consonant, they were presented with a
series of digits to be processed according to the list completion
paradigm. Pure lists involved either parity or magnitude judgments, whereas mixed lists required participants to alternate between parity and magnitude judgments of the digits. We predicted
poorer recall in the mixed list than in the pure list conditions.

Method
Participants. Nineteen first-year psychology students at Ghent
University participated for course requirements and credit. All
participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, were righthanded, and were naı̈ve to the purpose of the experiment.
Tasks and material. A continuous span task designed by Barrouillet et al. (2004) was used. During a continuous span task, two
constituent tasks need to be coordinated. Participants were presented with series of three to six consonants to be remembered.
Consonants in each series were drawn from 13 groups with low

481

intergroup confusability based on their Dutch pronunciation
(Vandierendonck, De Vooght, & Van der Goten, 1998). These
groups were: (B, D, P, T), (C), (F, S), (G), (H, K), (J), (L), (M, N),
(Q), (R), (V, W), (X), (Z). After each consonant, a series of eight
digits (from 1 to 9, without 5) colored in either red or blue was
sequentially displayed on screen. These series were randomly
generated with the restriction that immediate stimulus repetition
was avoided. When the digit was red, the participants had to decide
whether it was larger or smaller than 5, by pressing a right or a left
key, respectively. If it was blue, participants judged its parity by
pressing the right or the left key for even and odd numbers,
respectively. Previous research has shown that these response
mappings are consistent with the mental representations of numbers in long-term memory, thus avoiding spurious compatibility
effects (Dehaene, Bossini, & Giraux, 1993; Nuerk, Iversen, &
Willmes, 2004). For both judgments the right hand had to be used.
Three types of digit lists were created: (a) 8 lists containing only
parity judgments; (b) 8 lists containing only magnitude comparisons, and (c) 16 mixed lists in which the participants had to
alternate between the parity and the magnitude tasks. In this way,
for each length of the letter sequence (three, four, five, or six
consonants), 4 simple and 4 mixed lists were presented. This
resulted in a total of 32 lists to be performed.
Procedure. The participants were tested in groups of two by
means of Pentium III personal computers with 17-inch color
monitors running the Tscope experimentation software (Stevens,
Lammertyn, Verbruggen, & Vandierendonck, 2006). The instructions were presented on-screen and paraphrased if necessary. A
practice session of three blocks preceded the experimental sessions. In the first practice block, one letter series of each length
was presented, and participants had to memorize the consonants
without processing the digits presented after each consonant. In the
second block, participants processed the digits without memorizing the consonants, whereas in the last block, both letter memorization and digit processing had to be performed.
After these three practice blocks, the experiment proper started.
The letter– digit lists were presented in a random order. The course
of events for each list was as follows: First, the length and the type
of the list were announced in the middle of the screen (e.g., “4
consonants—magnitude task”). Second, a consonant was presented for 1,500 ms, followed by a 300-ms blank. Next, a digit
appeared for 900 ms followed by a 300-ms blank. When the eight
digits were presented, the next consonant appeared, and so on. The
time course of these events was fixed. Even when participants did
not respond to the digits, the sequence continued. At the end of a
list, participants had to recall the consonants in the correct order by
typing the letters on the keyboard with their left hand. The recalled
consonants were presented on a display on-screen. Whenever the
participants had forgotten an item, they pressed the spacebar and a
question mark appeared instead of a letter. The experiment lasted
about 1 hr.

Results
The specific impact of task switching on working memory
maintenance was investigated by considering the recall performance, the quality of digit processing, and the size of the switch
cost as a function of the different lists’ lengths. These latter
analyses focused on the last series of digits in each series of letters

because it is only there that the memory load equated the length of
the series of letters.
Recall performance. We first computed the average span for
the pure and the mixed lists by summing the number of correctly
recalled consonants for both types of lists across all list lengths
(Friedman & Miyake, 2005). The average span was higher for the
pure lists (63.68 out of 72) compared with that for the mixed lists
(58.32), F(1, 18)⫽ 5.07, p ⬍ .05. Next, the quality of recall was
considered for each list length. First, the absolute recall performance was computed. For each series the proportion of recalled
consonants in absolute correct order was calculated. For instance,
when presented P, Q, R, D and recalling P, Q, R, D, the score was
4 out of 4 and the recall proportion was 1. However, when P, D,
Q, R was recalled, the score was 1 out of 4 (proportion .25)
because only the first consonant matched its presentation position.
Because this is a very strict measure of recall, we also considered
relative recall quality. Following a method used by Vandierendonck, Kemps, Fastame, and Szmalec (2004) and Szmalec,
Vandierendonck, and Kemps (2005), Kendall’s tau rank correlation between the presented series and the recalled series was
weighted with the recall performance without consideration of the
correctness of the ranking.1 Both measures were separately subjected to a 2 (pure lists vs. mixed lists) by 4 (list length) multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Absolute recall was
poorer for mixed lists (.82) compared with pure lists (.90), F(1,
18) ⫽ 7.57, p ⬍ .05, and decreased as a function of list length (.89,
.92, .86, and .77), F(3, 16) ⫽ 10.59, p ⬍ .001 (see Table 1). These
effects did not interact, F(3, 16) ⫽ 1.31, p ⫽ .31. The relative
recall performance mirrored these findings. The relative recall was
lower for the mixed lists (.88) compared with the pure lists (.92),
F(1, 18) ⫽ 8.88, p ⬍ .01, and recall performance decreased as a
function of the increasing list length (.90, .94, .89, and .87), F(3,
16) ⫽ 11.75, p ⬍ .001. No interaction was observed, F ⬍ 1.
Digit processing. Performance on the numerical judgment
tasks can be analyzed in terms of latency and accuracy. First, we
studied the average amount of time participants focused on the
processing of the digits in each list. For each list, the total time
spent on average on the processing of the digits between the
presentation of two consecutive consonants was calculated irrespective of whether the digits’ judgments were correct or not.
These digit processing times were then averaged according to the
type and the length of the lists. A 2 (pure lists vs. mixed lists) by
4 (list length) MANOVA was conducted on these mean processing

times (see Table 2). The digit processing times were larger (5,966
ms) for the mixed lists than for the pure lists (4,667 ms), F(1,
18) ⫽ 77.91, p ⬍ .001, and did not increase with list length, either
for the pure list, F ⬍ 1, or for the mixed list, F(1, 18)
⫽ 2.08, p ⫽ .17.
The average number of errors produced while processing the
eight digits between two consecutive consonants was also subjected to a 2 (pure lists vs. mixed lists) by 4 (list length) MANOVA
(see Table 2). The mean number of errors was larger for the mixed
lists (1.92) compared with the pure lists (.88), F(1, 18) ⫽ 55.31, p ⬍
.001, and increased with the list length (1.28, 1.37, 1.39, and 1.57),
F(3, 16) ⫽ 3.49, p ⬍ .05. These effects did not interact, F ⬍ 1.
Memory load by task switching. In the next step, we focused
on the possible influence of working memory load on task switching performance by conducting a 2 (pure list vs. mixed list) by 4
(list length) MANOVA on the average latencies of the last sequence of digits for each list length. For this analysis, trials that
were incorrect, trials immediately following incorrect trials, and
trials including latencies smaller than 100 ms or larger than 1,200
ms (overlapping with the next digit) were discarded from the data
analyses. Also, trials following trials with latencies larger than
1,200 ms (overlaps from previous responses) were discarded. A

indication of task switching performance (see Table 3). The latencies were longer for the mixed lists (708 ms) than for the pure lists

Kendall’s tau is a measure of ranked correlation that measures the level
of disarray for a pair of samples. The value of Kendall’s tau lies between
⫹1 (complete concordance between both samples) and –1 (complete
disagreement). In the present study, Kendall’s tau was used to calculate
ranking correctness by comparing the order of the presented consonants
with the order of recalled consonants. This calculation is based on the
position of a consonant relative to the other consonants in the string, so it
captures more of the data than an absolute determination of correct position. To avoid attenuated ranges, we subjected this rank correlation to an
arcsine transformation and linearly rescaled this outcome in order to obtain
an index between 0 and 1. Hence, negative values were avoided. This was
of importance when multiplying this transformed tau with the free recall
performance. For example, when presented P, Q, R, D and recalling P, R,
Q, D, the relative recall is .73, while the absolute recall is .50. Although
only the first and the last consonant matched their presentation order,
relatively seen, only the R was recalled incorrectly compared with the Q.

Discussion
The results of Experiment 1 were twofold. First, recall performance was significantly poorer for mixed lists than for pure lists.
The presence of task switches thus impaired working memory
maintenance. The analyses clearly indicated that participants were
engaged in processing digits for a larger amount of time with
mixed lists than with pure lists. Hence, the cognitive load induced
by mixed-list processing was higher than the average cognitive
load due to pure lists, and this resulted in a more detrimental effect
on the maintenance of letter series in mixed lists.
We also observed an influence of the concurrent memory load
on pure lists but not on mixed lists, resulting in a decrease of the
global switching cost under memory load. It is possible that due to
different attentional demands, mixed and pure lists were affected
in a different way by the concurrent load. Because pure lists
involved a single task and hence simpler processing activities, it is
possible that participants were more prone to postpone the treatment of the digits while refreshing the memory traces of the letters
in the pure lists than in the more complex mixed lists, in which
they prioritized digit processing rather than refreshment. This kind
of a strategy-related effect has already been observed in dual tasks
(Camos & Barrouillet, 2004). Such a discrepancy would account
for the fact that reaction times increased with memory load in pure
lists but remained unchanged in mixed lists. Experiment 2 further
examined this issue.
Taken together, the results of Experiment 1 showed a neat
relation between task switching and working memory by demonstrating that task switching impedes the maintenance of consonants
in working memory. In the next experiment, we wanted to replicate this finding by using a more fine grained operationalization.
To this end, the number of switches was varied parametrically,
ranging from lists with a few switches to lists with many switches,
and the task switches were made less predictable.

Experiment 2
In contrast to Experiment 1, Experiment 2 used a task-cueing
procedure in which participants alternate between two or more

choice reaction tasks according to a pattern that is unpredictable
and controlled by cues (Meiran, 1996). The switch cost is defined
as the difference between trials that repeat the same task as the
previous trial, and trials that involve a different task from the
previous trial. This methodology offers some advantages compared with the list-completion procedure. Previous research argued
that the difference between pure and mixed lists does not only
concern the systematic switching between two tasks, but also the
maintenance of two task sets as compared with only one task set in
pure lists (Rogers & Monsell, 1995), higher demands on interference control (Rubin & Meiran, 2005), and the tracking of task
sequences (Bryck & Mayr, 2005). In contrast, the task-cueing
procedure constitutes a different situation, since task repetitions
and task switches are both performed within the context of a mixed
list. Hence, as both task sets are present throughout a mixed list,
the situation is more similar for repetition and switch trials. This
difference in methodology could be crucial for the present research
question. The difference in recall performance we observed in
Experiment 1 could reflect different working memory demands of
pure and mixed lists that are independent of the processes underlying task switching per se. For example, the need to keep an
additional task set active in a mixed list could have disrupted the
maintenance of consonants and produced poorer recall.
In Experiment 2, we compared recall performance on two continuous span tasks that differed only in the number of switches
involved by their processing component. Both conditions contained the same series of digits, the order of which was manipu2
In order to further investigate the influence of a concurrent memory
load on task switching, we conducted an additional analysis in which the
digit-processing task was divided into two blocks by grouping the first four
and the last four trials. Switch costs in both blocks were then compared.
The underlying idea was that switch costs may increase as a function of the
number of concurrent consonants in only the first block and not in the
second block. The reason for this is that participants would rehearse the
concurrent items only when processing the first digits but not afterward.
However, the interaction between list lengths, list type, and block was not
significant for either the latencies, F ⬍ 1, or the error rates, F ⬍ 1. The
absence of such interactions thus suggests that the influence of the consonants on digit processing was similar for the beginning and the end of the
last processing phase.

lated to create high- and low-switch lists in the same way as in
Logan (2004; Experiment 4). If the difference in recall performance observed in Experiment 1 was only due to the maintenance
of an additional task set in the mixed lists, no difference in recall
performance should appear in the present experiment. By contrast,
our hypothesis was that it is task switching performance that
involves a cognitive cost and not the presence of an additional task
set. Thus, we predicted that recall performance would be more
impaired for high-switch lists compared with the low-switch lists.
Second, we further investigated the influence of concurrent loads
on the switch cost. If the previous results are due to the nature of
the mixed lists and their induction of a higher priority for processing, the decrease in switch costs that we observed in Experiment 1
should not be replicated, because mixed lists were presented in
both conditions of Experiment 2.

Method
Participants. Nineteen first-year psychology students at Ghent
University participated for course requirements and credit. All
participants met the same criteria as in the previous experiment
and did not participate to the previous experiment.
Materials and procedure. The procedure and the materials
were identical to those in Experiment 1 except that only two types
of lists were created, by manipulating the order of appearance of
the colored digits: 16 low-switch lists with two or three switches
per eight digits, and 16 high-switch lists with five or six switches.
The distribution of the switches along a sequence of digits was
random in both types of lists, with the restriction that the occurrence of both tasks was in balance within each list. For each list
length, 4 low-switch and 4 high-switch lists were presented, resulting in a total of 32 lists to be performed. For each sequence, the
list length was announced but not the number of switches. The
experiment lasted about 1 hr.

Results

low-switch lists (56.16 out of 72) than for the high-switch list
(52.84), F(1, 18) ⫽ 5.78, p ⬍ .05. A 2 (low-switch vs. high-switch
lists) by 4 (list length) MANOVA was conducted on the absolute

performance was larger on low-switch lists (.80) than on highswitch lists (.75), F(1, 18) ⫽ 7.39, p ⬍ .05, and decreased as a
function of list length (.86, .81, .75, and .70), F(3, 16) ⫽ 12.06,

recall performance, the difference between both lists remained (.86

decrease as a function of list length, F(3, 16) ⫽ 1.61, p ⫽ .23. The
effects did not interact, F ⬍ 1.
Digit processing. The digit processing times and the mean
numbers of errors were computed as in Experiment 1. A 2 (lowswitch vs. high-switch lists) by 4 (list length) MANOVA was
performed on both the processing times and numbers of errors (see
Table 5). The digit-processing times were longer for the highswitch list (5,908 ms) compared with the low-switch list (5,602
ms), F(1, 18) ⫽ 29.93, p ⬍ .001, and remained equal across the
different list lengths, F ⬍ 1. The effects did not interact, F ⬍ 1.
The number of errors was larger for the high-switch list (1.79) than
for the low-switch list (1.52), F(1, 18) ⫽ 12.23, p ⬍ .01, and
increased marginally with list length, F(3, 16) ⫽ 2.47, p ⫽ .099

influence of memory load on task switching, the same exclusion
criteria as in Experiment 1 were used, and 18% of the trials were
removed. A 2 (low-switch vs. high-switch lists) by 2 (task repetition vs. task switching) by 4 (list length) MANOVA was con-

number of task switches imposed by the task order, it can be
concluded that task switching itself involves a cognitive load that
leads to an impaired maintenance. The fact that the effect on recall
was rather small compared with that in Experiment 1 suggests that
in the previous experiment the impairment of working memory
maintenance by task switching was overestimated due to the use of
list completion. It should also be remembered that based on the
time-based resource-sharing model, it is assumed that task switching impairs working memory maintenance because task switching
occupies attention. As a consequence, the effect of this attentional
occupation on maintenance cannot go beyond, and should be
commensurate with, the extra time resulting from the increase in
the number of switches, which was about 190 ms within a postletter interval. Thus, a large disruptive effect on recall could not be
expected from so subtle a variation in attentional demand. Nonetheless, this variation proved to be sufficient to significantly impair
the maintenance of the letters and impair their recall.
In line with the interpretation of Camos and Barrouillet (2004),
switch costs remained unaffected by the concurrent memory load.
Whatever the number of letters to be maintained, the switch cost
remained essentially constant. This result suggests that the decrease in mixing cost associated with the increase in the number of
letters to be maintained that was observed in Experiment 1 was
probably due to the fact that the two conditions under comparison
involved different list types, which in turn induced different strategies in our participants. The lack of effect of the concurrent
memory load on the switch cost is at odds with previous studies,
where it was observed that concurrent articulatory suppression
affected the size of the switch cost (e.g., Liefooghe et al., 2005;
Miyake et al., 2004). As a possible interpretation, this lack of
effect of verbal load on task switching could be attributed to an
insufficiently strong manipulation of the size of the verbal load.
For example, it could be that the number of items to be concur3
As in Experiment 1, an additional analysis was conducted in order to
find out whether the observed load effects were similar for the beginning
and the end of the last processing phase. Again the interaction between list
lengths, trial type, and block failed to be significant both for the latencies,

length (three, four, five, six, seven, or eight consonants), four lists
were presented, resulting in the presentation of 48 lists. The
experiment lasted about 45 min.

rently maintained (six consonants) was not large enough to find
any effect. Moreover, it has been suggested that in a complex span
task the load that is induced by the maintenance of items could be
undermined by using strategies involving long-term memory storage (e.g., Saito & Miyake, 2004). In view of these possibilities,
Experiment 3 employed a paradigm in which participants had to
maintain a memory preload while processing a series of only eight
digits and recall the preload immediately afterward. This way, the
amount of time between the presentation of the preload and the
recall of the preload was drastically reduced, thus minimizing the
possible involvement of strategies based on long-term memory
storage. At the same time, it was possible to increase the number
of consonants to be maintained up to eight.

latencies, F ⬍ 1. Finally, none of the interactions was significant;

Experiment 3
As in the previous experiment, we contrasted the recall performance on high- and low-switch lists, but we used preloading
instead of a continuous span task design. First, participants were
presented with a sequence of consonants immediately followed by
a series of eight digits to be processed at a pace fixed by the
computer. After processing this series, participants recalled the
consonants in the correct serial order. With the aim of increasing
the maintenance demands on working memory, six list lengths
ranging from three to eight consonants were presented. The prediction was the same as in the previous experiments. We expected
poorer recall performance for high-switch lists than for low-switch
lists. Additionally, we investigated whether the switch cost also
remained unchanged across the different sizes of the memory
preload.

Method
Participants. Twenty-four first-year psychology students at
Ghent University participated for course requirements and credit.
All participants met the same criteria as in the previous experiment.
Materials and procedure. The materials in Experiment 3 were
identical to those of Experiment 2 except that the consonants were
presented as a list before the digits and the list length now varied
from three to eight consonants. The course of events for each list
was essentially the same as in Experiment 2. The consonants were
serially presented at a rate of 1,500 ms per consonant followed by

Discussion
Although a different procedure was used, the results of Experiment 3 mirrored the effects observed in Experiment 2. Recall
performance on the high-switch lists was poorer than on the
low-switch lists, and memory load did not affect the switch cost.
These results offer a nice generalization of the relation between
task switching and working memory maintenance that we observed in the previous experiment. In the present experiment, the
delay between encoding and recall was less than 10 s, and only one
series of digits had to be processed. As already mentioned, the
concurrent load did not affect task switching performance. Even
when the storage demands on working memory were increased to
eight letters, the difference between task switching and task repetition remained unchanged. Contrary to the results of Experiment
2, there was no effect of list length on error rates. This rules out
any possibility that an increase of the switch cost could be concealed by a speed–accuracy trade-off. Exactly as in Experiment 2,
when sufficient time pressure is induced, the frequency of switches
had a detrimental effect on the maintenance of consonants, but the
concurrent load did not influence the processing of the digits.
In a series of three experiments taken together, we have demonstrated that task switching clearly impairs working memory
maintenance. According to the time-based resource-sharing model,
the effect on concurrent maintenance of a given activity is proportionate to the time during which this activity occupies attention
(Barrouillet et al., 2007). Experiment 4 was designed to verify this
assumption concerning the effect of task switching on working
memory.

Experiment 4
In this final experiment, the cause of the effects observed in the
previous experiments was further investigated. As mentioned in

the introduction, the time-based resource-sharing model assumes
that the impairment that task switching has on the maintenance of
information in working memory is determined by the amount of
time it occupies attention. In other words, this impairment is not
inherent to task switching but rather follows from general timeconsuming attentional demands. Experiment 4 tested this assumption. To this end, a variant of Experiment 3 was conducted in
which not only the number of switches was manipulated but also
the degradation of the stimuli to which the digit-processing tasks
were applied. Stimulus degradation is known to put special demands on cognitive control, possibly through additional monitoring and adaptation mechanisms (e.g., Barch et al., 1997; Kok,
1986; Yeung & Cohen, 2006). Additionally, Rubinstein et al.
(2001) demonstrated that stimulus degradation, which is especially
of importance to stimulus identification processes, did not affect
the size of the switch cost. If the main cause of the impairment of
working memory maintenance due to task switching is the amount
of time attention is occupied, then a stimulus degradation occupying attention for a similar amount of time should impair working
memory maintenance to the same extent as task switching and lead
to comparable recall performance.

Method
Participants. Twenty-five first-year psychology students at
Ghent University participated for course requirements and credit.
All participants met the same criteria as in the previous experiment.
Material and procedure. For each of the list lengths—four,
six, and eight—three list types were created: (a) lists with normal
digits and a few switches; (b) lists with normal digits and many
switches; and (c) lists with a few switches but with degraded digits.
This degradation was obtained by adding static visual noise on top
of the presented digits (Holcomb, 1993). For each digit presentation, the digit was covered by a virtual square in which 70% of the
pixels was randomly highlighted (see Figure 4). These pixels and
the digits they covered were presented in blue or red depending on
4
Again an additional analysis was conducted in order to find out
whether the observed preload effects were similar for the beginning and the
end of the processing phase. However, the interaction between list lengths,
trial type, and block failed to be significant for either the latencies, F ⬍ 1,
or the error rates, F(5, 19) ⫽1.14, p ⫽ .37.

the task to be performed, with red indicating the magnitude task
and blue indicating the parity task. This way, only the identity of
the digit was degraded but not the salience of the cue. The course
of events for each list was the same as in Experiment 3. For each
list type (low-switch lists with normal digits, high-switch list with
normal digits, and low-switch lists with degraded digits) and
length (four, six, or eight consonants), four lists were presented,
resulting in the presentation of 36 lists. The experiment lasted
about 40 min.

Results
Digit-processing times and recall performance. Digitprocessing times were obtained as in the previous experiments and
subjected to a 3 (list type) by 3 (list length) MANOVA (see Table
10). Digit processing was significantly faster for low-switch lists
with normal digits (5,840 ms) than for the other lists, F(1, 24) ⫽
56.81, p ⬍ .001. More importantly, the high-switch lists with
normal digits (6,164 ms) and the low-switch lists with degraded
stimuli (6,234 ms) were processed equally fast, F ⬍ 1, thus
creating appropriate conditions for the test of our hypothesis of an
effect on recall performance related to the duration of attentional
occupation. There was no significant effect of list length, F ⬍ 1,
and no interaction between both effects, F ⬍ 1.

As we expected, the average recall score was larger in lowswitch lists with normal digits (53.84 out of 72) than in highswitch lists with normal digits (49.24), F(1, 24) ⫽ 5.77, p ⬍ .05,
and than in low-switch lists with degraded digits (49.22), F(1,
24) ⫽ 5.29, p ⬍ .05. In line with our time-based account of
resource sharing, the latter conditions did not differ from each
other, F ⬍ 1. The analyses of absolute and relative recall performance confirmed these results. Both scores were subjected to a 3
(list type) by 3 (list length) MANOVA (see Table 11). Absolute
recall was larger for the low-switch lists with normal digits (.77)
than for the remaining two lists, F(1, 24) ⫽ 8.79, p ⬍ .01, while
the latter two lists yielded an equal recall score (.72 and .73,
respectively), F ⬍ 1. Recall performance decreased with list length
(.91, .73, and .57), F(2, 23) ⫽ 68.91, p ⬍ .001. The interaction
between both effects was not significant, F ⬍ 1. Relative recall
performance was also larger for the lists with low-switch and
normal digits (.84) than for the other lists (.80 and .81, respectively), F(1, 24) ⫽ 5.93, p ⬍ .05, and the latter lists again yielded
similar recall scores, F(1, 24) ⫽ 1.31, p ⫽ .24. Furthermore, the
relative recall decreased as a function of list length (.93, .81, and
.73), F(2, 23) ⫽ 56.38, p ⬍ .001. These effects did not interact,
F ⬍ 1.

Memory load by task switching. The exclusion criteria of the
previous experiments were used, and 19% of the trials were
removed. A 3 (list type) by 3 (list length) by 2 (task repetition vs.
task switching) MANOVA was performed (see Table 12). The
latencies were shorter for the low-switch lists with normal digits
(685 ms) than for the high-switch list with normal stimuli (706
ms), F(1, 24) ⫽ 6.15, p ⫽ .05, and the latencies on this latter list
were shorter than on the low-switch list with degraded stimuli (750
ms), F(1, 24) ⫽ 36.49, p ⬍ .001. List length did not affect the
latencies, F(2, 23) ⫽ 1.03, p ⫽ .37, and task repetition was faster
than task switching (676 ms and 751 ms, respectively, with a
switch cost of 75 ms), F(1, 24) ⫽ 202.92, p ⬍ .001. The interaction between list type and task switching, and the interaction
between list length and task switching, were not significant, Fs ⬍
1 (see Figure 5). The error rates indicated that low-switch lists with
normal digits were associated with fewer errors (.18) than with the
other lists, F(1, 24) ⫽ 6.38, p ⬍ .001, while the other lists did not
differ significantly (.20 and .22, respectively), F(1, 24) ⫽ 2.27,
p ⫽ .14. The error rates did not increase as a function of list length,
F(2, 23) ⫽ 1.33, p ⫽ .28, and fewer errors were made on repetition
trials (.17) than on switch trials (.24), F(1, 24) ⫽ 31.58, p ⬍ .001.
Finally, the switch cost was not affected by list type or by list
length, Fs ⬍ 1.5

Discussion
In line with the time-based resource-sharing model, the degree
of recall impairment was of a similar size for both low-switch lists
with degraded stimuli and high-switch lists with normal stimuli, as
was the extent to which the processing time was increased. These
results confirm the prediction that the key factor underlying the
impairment of working memory maintenance by a cognitive activity is the amount of time this cognitive activity occupies attention (Barrouillet et al., 2004, 2007).

This interpretation could be challenged in the light of many
studies using the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm
in which participants are asked to respond to two successive
targets at varying stimulus onset asynchronies. In this paradigm, it
seems that stimulus degradation affects processing stages prior to
attention, the early processing steps that are slowed down by
degradation being carried out in parallel with other resourcedemanding processes such as response selection. Indeed, it has
been shown that increasing the difficulty of processing of the
second target by stimulus degradation results in an underadditive
interaction between the manipulated factor and the stimulus-onset
asynchrony (SOA) as SOA is decreased. This underadditive interaction suggests that the early stages of processing of the second
target have been carried out in parallel with central-attentiondemanding stages of the first task (Pashler, 1984; Pashler &
Badgio, 1985). As a consequence, stimulus degradation in our
experiment could not be considered as involving attentiondemanding processes that could impair the concurrent refreshment
of memory traces.
However, it is worth noting that these phenomena seem to be
confined to the PRP paradigm. Interestingly, the underadditivity of the interaction disappears when stimulus degradation is
used in a task-switching paradigm. Oriet and Jolicoeur (2003),
using an alternating runs paradigm in which participants judged
digits for parity and magnitude as in our experiments, observed
that the effect of stimulus degradation did not differ as a
function of whether participants switched or repeated tasks.
From the additive effects of task switching and degradation, the
authors concluded that task switching may impose a hard bottleneck even for early stimulus processing. Now, it is important
to note that in our continuous span procedure, participants must
not only switch back and forth between parity and magnitude
judgments but also from maintenance activities to digit processing at stimulus onset. What is demonstrated by Oriet and
Jolicoeur (2003) is that early processing of digits waits until
task set reconfiguration or whatever operation responsible for
the task switch cost is completed. Thus, it can be assumed that
stimulus degradation within our paradigm induced a prolonged
occupation of attention that resulted in the predicted impairment of maintenance and recall.

General Discussion
Although a close relationship between task switching and working memory has often been postulated (e.g., Baddeley et al., 2001;
Emerson & Miyake, 2003; Mayr & Kliegl, 2000, 2003; Rubinstein
et al., 2001), there was a lack of direct evidence supporting this
relationship (e.g., Friedman et al., 2006; Miyake et al., 2000) and
a lack of evidence indicating that task switching places additional
demands on working memory (e.g., Kane et al., 2007; Logan,
2004; see also Hogan, Kelly, & Craik, 2006). The present study
was designed to clarify this issue by investigating the impairment
of working memory functioning due to task switching within
5
As in the previous experiments, the additional analysis was conducted
to test whether the observed load effects were similar for the beginning and
the end of the processing phase. The interaction between list lengths, trial
type, and block, however, failed to be significant for either the latencies,
F ⬍ 1, or the error rates, F ⬍ 1.

computer-paced continuous span tasks issuing from the time-based
resource-sharing model (Barrouillet et al., 2004). All four experiments indicated that task switching impaired working memory
maintenance, whereas the size of the switch cost remained unaffected by the number of consonants to be maintained. In the
following sections, we first address the implications of the relationship between task switching and working memory maintenance for different accounts of task switching. Next, we discuss
how different accounts of task switching and different conceptions
of working memory architecture and resource sharing can account
for the absence of an influence of working memory load on the
size of the switch cost.

Task Switching and Working Memory Maintenance
The present results suggest that task switching calls upon working memory functioning to a strong enough extent to impair the
concurrent maintenance of items in working memory. Furthermore, the impairment observed is a function of the additional
amount of time task switching occupies attention compared with
Table 12
Reaction Times of the Task-Switching Performance During the
Digit Processing of Experiment 4 as a Function of Preload, List
Type, and Trial Type (Repetition or Switch)

task repetition. As a consequence, the amount of time that attention
could be devoted to the refreshment of decaying memory traces
was shorter during task switching than during task repetition. This
resulted in more deterioration of working memory maintenance
when the number of task switches increased.
On the one hand, the present findings can be connected in a
straightforward way to the research assuming that switch costs are
elicited by additional task set reconfiguration processes mediated
by working memory (Baddeley et al., 2001; Emerson & Miyake,
2003; Mayr & Kliegl, 2000, 2003). In this perspective, our results
are consistent with the hypothesis that when the number of
switches increases, the total time involved in task set reconfiguration also increases. Because each change occupies attention for
some time through processes of task set reconfiguration such as
long-term retrieval (Mayr & Kliegl, 2000, 2003) or task set inhibition (Mayr & Kliegl, 2000), the amount of time left to refresh the
decaying memory traces is reduced when the number of switches
is increased. In turn, this results in the impairment of working
memory maintenance. On the other hand, our findings can be
linked equally well to accounts that do not assume task set reconfiguration. For instance, on the assumption that switch costs follow
from the interaction between task set priming and executive control (e.g., Gilbert & Shallice, 2002; Yeung & Monsell, 2003), our

WORKING MEMORY COSTS OF TASK SWITCHING

results would then indicate that biasing top-down control in view
of task set priming impairs working memory maintenance.
In a similar vein, it has been proposed that switch costs may
result from facilitative priming of instructional task cues. In the
task-cueing procedure, the same procedure we used in Experiments 2– 4, switch costs are to a large extent accounted for by cue
switches rather than by actual task switches (e.g., Logan &
Bundesen, 2003, 2004; Mayr & Kliegl, 2003). D. W. Schneider
and Logan (2005) proposed that in the task-cueing procedure, the
perceptual representation of the cue must be compared with the
transient representation of the possible cues in short-term memory.
Although the activation of these representations decays in the
interval between trials, there is some residual activation from the
previous trial. Switch costs thus result from differences in residual
activations that prime cue encoding. While such account discards
task set reconfiguration, encoding cues and comparing their perceptual representation with transient representations in short-term
memory remain processes that require attention. Accordingly, we
assume that the difference between task-repetition and task-switch
trials is that the former trials occupy attention for shorter periods
of time because cue encoding and comparison are faster. As a
consequence, even when endorsing the cue-encoding account, task
switching will disrupt concurrent maintenance because it involves
an attentional demand for a longer period of time.
In sum, our results show that processing differences related to
task switching involve attention-demanding control processes. Additionally, the results of Experiment 4 even demonstrate that
working memory impairment due to task switching is mediated by
processes that are in fact not specific to the task-switching performance. Task switching interferes with the maintenance of items in
working memory because, on task-switch trials, attention is occupied for a certain amount of time without opportunity for compensatory activities within the strictly controlled environment we
used. This is in line with previous findings indicating that any task
that occupies attention disrupts concurrent maintenance because it
impedes, at least for short periods of time, the refreshment of the
decaying memory traces (Barrouillet et al., 2004, 2007).

Working Memory Load and Switch Costs
An important finding of the present study is that switch costs
remained unaffected by working memory load. In Experiments
2– 4, increasing the number of items to be maintained concurrently
during task switching did not increase the size of the switch cost.
On the one hand, this finding challenges the proposal that task sets
are maintained by working memory itself (e.g., Logan & Gordon,
2001; Mayr & Kliegl, 2000, 2003) and is consistent with the idea
that some task elements, such as response codes, are represented in
the activated part of long-term memory (e.g., Kiesel et al., 2007;
Meiran & Kessler, 2008; Rubin & Meiran, 2005). It is important to
note that this conclusion does not contradict our central finding
that task switching taxes the maintenance of information in working memory. According to time-based resource sharing, the crucial
element is the amount of time attention is occupied by task
switching and not the amount of information to be maintained
actively during task switching. The finding that stimulus degradation also impaired the maintenance of consonants offers a nice test
of this claim, as such manipulation does require additional processing but not the maintenance of additional information. Taken

491

together, the asymmetry we observed (i.e., task-switching impairing information maintenance, while concurrent load not affecting
task switching) seems to suggest that task switching is related to
working memory through simple attention-demanding processes
but not through the active maintenance of task-related information.
Although the focus of the present article is mainly on the
relation between task switching and working memory, the absence
of an effect of a concurrent load on task switching must also be
considered in relation to working memory theories. For instance,
on the basis of the task span procedure, Logan (2004) concluded
that task switching and information maintenance in working memory call on different resources and do not compete for the same
limited supply. In other words, task switching and working memory would be supported by different resources within a multiresource working memory framework.
Trade-offs between the processing and the maintenance of information in working memory have been considered as a strong
indication of a single-resource working memory system (e.g.,
Daneman & Carpenter, 1980; Just & Carpenter, 1992; Lovett,
Reder, & Lebière, 1999), while the absence of such trade-offs has
been interpreted as evidence favoring a working memory architecture consisting of multiple resources, with separate resources
for the processing and for the maintenance of information (e.g.,
Kieras, Meyer, Mueller, & Seymour, 1999; W. Schneider &
Detweiler, 1987). All the experiments in the present study revealed
an impact of task switching on maintenance of information, lending strong support to the time-based resource-sharing model,
which assumes that both the processing and the maintenance of
information within working memory require attention, which is a
single limited resource that must be shared.
It should be noted that, according to the classic view of the
trade-off, performance on one component is inversely proportional
to performance on the other component (e.g., Navon & Gopher,
1979; Sperling & Melchner, 1978). In the present study, it was
observed that the number of switches had a negative impact on the
maintenance of the consonants but, conversely, that the number of
consonants to be maintained had no influence on task switching, a
result converging with recent findings by Logan (2007; Experiment 4) suggesting that load per se does not affect switch costs. In
other words, our findings do not conform to working memory
theories that assume continuous sharing of a single resource between processing and storage. Indeed, these theories would expect
that an increase in the number of items to be maintained would
lead to a decrease in resources available for processing. Thus, they
would predict slower performance under memory load (e.g.,
Anderson, Reder, & Lebière, 1996; Just & Carpenter, 1992). As a
consequence, an increased memory load would have some impact
on task repetitions and a much larger impact on task switches,
resulting in a higher switch cost (panels B and B⬘ in Figure 6). In
line with this expectation, Baddeley et al. (2001) observed an
effect of a concurrent verbal load on the size of the switch cost.
Hence, though the time-based resource-sharing model predicts
that task switching impairs concurrent maintenance, this theory
predicts no effect of memory load on task switching. Of course, at
a macro level of analysis, the theory is consistent with a continuous
resource sharing between competing parallel activities. Yet, at a
micro level of analysis, it does not hypothesize such a continuous
sharing. Indeed, a basic assumption of the time-based resourcesharing model is that the attention to be shared between processing

Figure 6. Hypothesized effect of a concurrent memory load on the time
course of processing for repetition and switch trials according to either the
time-based resource-sharing model (panels A and A⬘) or theories assuming
a continuous sharing between competing processes (panels B and B⬘).
Panels A⬘ and B⬘ represent hypothesized time courses when a concurrent
memory load is added.

and maintenance is rapidly shifted between both activities. This
implies that when several things are going on at once, activities can
be postponed but their duration remains unchanged because, when
they are performed, they benefit from all the available attention
that is not divided between concurrent activities. For example, in
our experiments, participants could postpone the concurrent task in
order to give priority to the refreshment of the memory traces of
the letters. This postponement probably becomes longer when the
number of letters to be refreshed is larger. However, when the
tasks are computer-paced, such as our continuous span tasks, then
postponement could in some cases become impossible, and some
letters would be lost. Even in these extreme cases, however,
memory load affects only the duration of the postponement but not
the duration of the processing steps themselves. Indeed, the number of memory traces waiting for refreshment does not matter
when attention is devoted to a given processing step. As a consequence, the duration of processing steps should remain unchanged
for both repetition and switch trials, and the switch cost will
remain unaffected (see panels A and A⬘ in Figure 6).
Our results were precisely in line with these latter predictions. The
reaction times of the pure lists in Experiment 1 increased when the
number of consonants to be maintained increased, which is in agreement with the postponement idea, but in the subsequent experiments,
the performance on the mixed lists in general remained unaffected
when the number of consonants increased. More importantly, the size
of the switch cost remained unaffected. Additionally, the reaction
times displayed in Tables 3, 6, 9, and 12 for repetitions and switches
were quite fast considering the fact that these repetitions and switches
were performed in a dual-task situation. On average the reaction time
when processing a digit while maintaining eight consonants was 701
ms for Experiment 3 and 720 ms for Experiment 4. In comparison,
Verbruggen, Liefooghe, Vandierendonck, and Demanet (2007) used
the same tasks in similar conditions (i.e., indicated by meaningless
cues and supplying only a restricted amount of preparation time) but

without an additional working memory load. The average speed of
processing a digit under those circumstances varied from 781 ms to
825 ms. Those differences illustrate that when processing mixed lists,
participants preferred to give immediate and fast responses. So, depending on the list to be performed (pure or mixed), the processing of
the digits was either postponed or immediately executed. This is
consistent with proposals issuing from the domain of multitasking
research assuming that when individuals have to perform tasks at
virtually the same time (i.e., in the context of heavy time constraints),
they adopt scheduling strategies (Meyer & Kieras, 1997a, 1997b). It
is even possible that the adoption of different prioritization schemes in
either blocked or alternating lists led to the apparent increase in switch
cost observed by Baddeley et al. (2001). However, the strict control of
time parameters we adopted in the present study reveals that whatever
the strategy participants use, either postponing or immediately performing the secondary task, in neither case the findings are in agreement with the view that memory load increases switch cost as predicted by the theories assuming a continuously shared resource. Thus,
our results challenge the traditional single-resource conceptions of
working memory but support the hypothesis of a serial attention
switching as proposed by the time-based resource-sharing model.

Conclusion
In line with the time-based resource-sharing model, the present
experiments offer neat evidence that task switching impairs the maintenance of items in working memory, offering the empirical confirmation of the widespread assumption that task switching involves
working memory and consequently puts a cost on working memory
functioning. Moreover, we did not observe that increasing the load on
working memory modified the size of the switch cost, something
accounted for by the conception of resource sharing developed within
the time-based resource-sharing model. Additionally, the present
study indicated that the effect of task switching on concurrent maintenance of information in working memory did not necessarily rely
upon specific task set reconfiguration processes or task switching in
general, but resulted from the combination of simple and more fundamental attention-demanding processes.
