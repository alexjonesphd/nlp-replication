Modeling Distributions of Immediate Memory Effects:
No Strategies Needed?

Many models of immediate memory predict the presence or absence of various effects, but none have
been tested to see whether they predict an appropriate distribution of effect sizes. The authors show that
the feature model (J. S. Nairne, 1990) produces appropriate distributions of effect sizes for both the
phonological confusion effect and the word-length effect. The model produces the appropriate number
of reversals, when participants are more accurate with similar items or long items, and also correctly
predicts that participants performing less well overall demonstrate smaller and less reliable phonological
similarity and word-length effects and are more likely to show reversals. These patterns appear within the
model without the need to assume a change in encoding or rehearsal strategy or the deployment of a
different storage buffer. The implications of these results and the wider applicability of the distributionmodeling approach are discussed.
Keywords: memory modeling, individual differences, immediate recall

As noted by Logie and colleagues (Della Sala & Logie, 1997;
Logie, Della Sala, Laiacona, Chalmers, & Wynn, 1996), both PSEs
and WLEs are absent— or even reversed—in the recall protocols
of some normally functioning participants, suggesting that although these effects occur in the aggregate or group case traditionally studied within cognitive psychology, they are not necessarily present at the individual level. One purpose of the current
work is to determine the distribution of effect sizes observed when
standard PSE and WLE experiment methodologies are used. A
second purpose is to assess how well the feature model (Nairne,
1990) accounts for the observed interindividual variation. Although Melton (1967) noted that a theory of memory must, perforce, include a theory of individual differences in the processes
specified by the theory, few models of immediate memory actually
explore these processes in any detail (Lewandowsky & Heit,
2006).
The magnitude of some effects could vary among the population
for theoretically interesting reasons, and any candidate model of
the effects in question should track this variation. Both effects have
been linked to particular strategies. For example, it has been
suggested that the perceived difficulty of an immediate verbal
memory task might result in the abandonment of a phonological
code in favor of other, nonphonological, coding mechanisms (see
the debate between Baddeley & Larsen, 2007, and Jones et al.,
2007). Similarly, participants who more effectively use rehearsal
might show both superior overall performance and a larger effect
of word length than participants who do not use rehearsal, a line of
argument used in the developmental literature to differentiate the
performance of younger children from that of older children and
adults (Hitch & Halliday, 1983).
A previous study (Logie et al., 1996) reported reliable interindividual differences in PSEs and WLEs using a span technique to
establish the incidence of variation within a normal population and

A number of phenomena are assumed to typify the functioning
of immediate memory, including the acoustic confusion or phonological similarity effect (PSE; reduced recall levels for similar
sounding items; Conrad, 1964) and the word-length effect (WLE;
reduced recall for words with more syllables; Baddeley, Thomson,
& Buchanan, 1975). The PSE, for example, is frequently taken to
be the “signature” that indicates the involvement of the phonological store component of the working memory model (although, see
Jones, Hughes, & Macken, 2007). The WLE is often associated
with the operation of an articulatory rehearsal loop (although, see
Lovatt & Avons, 2001; Neath, Bireta, & Surprenant, 2003).
Among patient populations, the absence of such effects at the
individual level is used as evidence for impairment of particular
short-term memory functions (Silveri, Di Betta, Filippini, Leggio,
& Molinari, 1998; Vallar & Shallice, 1990). Thus, a reduced PSE
is often assumed to reflect the lack of a phonological storage
strategy or (in neuropsychological patients) damage to the phonological store. Similarly, a reduced WLE is easily interpreted (e.g.,
among young children and older adults) as reflecting poor articulatory rehearsal or, again among neuropsychological patients,
damage to the articulatory loop.

hence inform interpretation of neuropsychological patient data.
However, span scoring is less sensitive than serial recall or reconstruction, which record multiple errors per trial compared with
span scoring’s all-or-none system. Additionally, Logie et al.
(1996) interpreted their data in terms of a variety of strategy
choices among their participants, on the basis of postexperimental
questioning. There are a number of reasons to question this interpretation. First, Logie et al. provided no indication of how strategies were identified and classified, nor did they provide any
indication of interrater reliability in classifying strategies. Second,
post hoc introspective accounts are subject to a number of biases
and must be interpreted cautiously. Third, even if strategies are
both reported and classified correctly, covariation of strategy and
effect size constitutes a correlational, not necessarily a causal,
relationship. Fourth, when span was included as a covariate, the
“effect” of strategies reported by Logie et al. drops considerably.
A factor other than strategy choice must therefore be responsible
for the majority of the variation reported. Finally, although not
formally analyzed, Logie et al.’s results show a distribution of
effect sizes that appears normal, or close to normal, not the
bimodal distribution one might expect from a mix of phonological
and nonphonological encoding strategies. Given these issues, as
well as more recent theoretical work questioning the role of these
strategies (Hulme et al., 2006; Hulme, Surprenant, Bireta, Stuart,
& Neath, 2004; Nairne, 2002), we examine whether a nonstrategy
account of interindividual variation provides a viable model of the
data. This approach parallels other modeling studies showing that
strategy as an explanatory construct may not be required as frequently as often assumed (Brown & Hulme, 1995; Neath &
Nairne, 1995).

position of SM representation j and 0 otherwise. The number of
mismatches across the features is summed in the numerator of
Equation 1. The value N is the number of features in each of the
vectors, and a is a scaling parameter representing overall level of
attention.

The Feature Model

In the feature model, order information is represented as a point
in multidimensional space and this point can perturb (or drift)
along the relevant dimension as described by Estes’s (1972) equations. The probability that a cue’s encoded representation will
perturb along the position dimension during a particular time
interval is given by the parameter ␪ (which is held constant at .05);
perturbations are equally likely in either direction. The probability
that an item, I, will occupy a particular position, p, during the next
time interval, t ⫹ 1, is given by Equation 5:

Space precludes a detailed account of the feature model; the
implementation was identical to that used in other simulations
(Beaman, 2006; Neath, 1999, 2000; Neath & Nairne, 1995; Neath
& Surprenant, 2007). Here, we provide only an overview. The
basic idea is that recall is guided by a set of cues in primary
memory (PM), which are either more or less effective in identifying the target item or event from a search set defined within
secondary memory (SM). Cues do not decay but are subject to
interference. Anything that makes the cues less effective (e.g.,
similarity between the representations of to-be-recalled targets) or
degrades the cues such that two or more targets could fit the profile
specified by the cues renders recall less accurate.
Formally, items in SM and cues in PM are presumed to comprise vectors of modality-independent and modality-dependent
features. For simulation purposes, feature values are randomly
generated. The absolute number of features is largely irrelevant in
determining the major properties of the model (see, e.g., Figure 4.8
of Neath & Surprenant, 2003). The main source of interference in
the model is feature overwriting: If feature x of item n ⫹ 1 is the
same as feature x of item n, then feature x of item n is lost, or
overwritten, and returns a value of 0.
The relative number of accurate features available to cue the
item in SM dictates recall performance. The difference between
the target SM item and its PM cue is calculated according to
Equation 1. The value Mk is equal to 1 if the feature at position k
of PM cue i does not match the feature at the corresponding

The probability of recovering a sampled item is then given by
Equation 4, where c is a constant and r is the number of times the
sampled item has already been recalled on this trial. This equation
and the r parameter are used to reduce the likelihood of recalling
the same item on multiple occasions, which participants avoid
doing even when the same item is repeated within the to-berecalled list.

Recall begins by determining, for each cue in PM, which was most
likely in Position 1 originally. To recall the second item, the model
uses the cue that was most likely in Position 2, and so on (see
Neath, 1999, for more details).

BRIEF REPORTS

The feature model produces PSEs primarily through Equation 3.
Phonologically similar items are represented by vectors that have
a higher number of features (both modality independent and modality dependent) with the same value. This has the net effect of
increasing the value of the denominator and thus reducing the
probability of retrieving the appropriate item (see Nairne, 1990).
The WLE is explained by assuming that the more complex an
item, the more segments it contains, and therefore the more chance
there is of an error (see Neath & Nairne, 1995). Long words are
typically more complex than short words and therefore have more
segments, and so there is more chance of making an error when
assembling the segments for output (Caplan, Rochon, & Waters,
1992). If a segment error occurs, there is a loss of feature information, implemented by setting half of the modality-independent
features to 0 values (see Neath & Nairne, 1995, for full details).
The feature model was chosen to model distributions of PSEs and
WLEs for three reasons. First, it has been shown to account well for
both the main PSE and WLE data. Second, the model as currently
implemented does not include rehearsal or any other more complex
strategy. Any predictions of the model must therefore be strategy
independent and not reliant on the use of a particular maintenance or
rehearsal strategy. Third, the model lends itself to a type of simulation
previously used by Hintzman (1986, 1988) and more recently used by
Cooper, Schwartz, Yule, and Shallice (2005) in which one run of the
model is seen as analogous to one experimental trial for a real
participant. In an experiment, the experimenter averages over a series
of trials to produce the mean performance of a particular real participant. This is repeated for each participant to produce mean group
performance. Similarly, a modeler can average over an equivalent
number of simulation runs to produce the mean performance of what
Hintzman (1986, p. 416) termed a “pseudo-subject.” Averaging over
a group of pseudo-subjects is thus equivalent to averaging over a
group of real participants and permits the same types of analyses.
With this type of modeling, intraindividual variability among
pseudo-subjects is the result of random variation in generating the
values of the feature vectors and represents randomly fluctuating
variation of neural firing patterns accompanying the encoding of
each item (see Nesselroade & Salthouse, 2004, for a discussion of
whether intraindividual variability should be viewed as noise). In
contrast, interindividual variability is the consequence of different
starting parameters for each pseudo-subject and is held constant
for each pseudo-subject.

Immediate Memory Effects
PSEs and WLEs are defined by a general diminution in performance rather than a qualitative change in results (except where they
interact with other factors, e.g., Jones et al., 2007; Neath & Nairne,
1995). We report drops in performance associated with the experimental manipulations by participants and compare these to the predictions derived from running the model across a sample of pseudosubjects. Following Logie et al. (1996) and Neath, Farley, and
Surprenant (2003), effects are presented in terms of the difference
between the two conditions divided by performance in the control or
standard condition (for further discussion, see Neath & Surprenant,
2007). For example, in what follows the PSE is given by
PSE ⫽

where D is mean performance in the dissimilar condition and S is
mean performance in the similar condition. Similarly, the WLE is
given by

(9)

where Sh is mean performance in the short words condition and L
is mean performance in the long words condition.

Experiment 1
Experiment 1 compares recall performance of lists of phonologically similar items with recall of lists of dissimilar items. The
major difference between this and other published studies is the
number of participants.

Method
Participants. A total of 100 Purdue University undergraduates
who were native speakers of American English participated in
exchange for course credit.
Stimuli. The to-be-remembered items were 64 one-syllable
words used by Surprenant, Neath, and LeCompte (1999) to study
PSEs. An example similar list is vote, boat, goat, float, note, and
coat. An example dissimilar list is break, sick, vote, greet, rat, and
fun. Each word appeared in both similar and dissimilar lists (e.g.,
vote in the above example). Lists were randomized such that
participants saw the same words but in different random orders.
Procedure. Participants were informed that we were interested
in how accurately they could remember the order in which a series
of words had been presented. Each word was shown in uppercase,
center justified, for 1.5 s in the middle of the screen in 20-point
Helvetica font. After the final word was shown, six response
buttons became active and were labeled with the six words in
alphabetical order. The participants were asked to indicate the
presentation order by clicking on appropriately labeled buttons
using the mouse. For example, if they thought the first word was
break, they should click on the button labeled break first. If they
thought the third word was vote, they should click on the button
labeled vote third. Participants received 20 lists, half with dissimilar and half with similar items, and were informed they could take
rest breaks at any point. The order of dissimilar and similar trials
was randomly determined for each participant. Participants were
tested individually, and an experimenter remained in the room to
ensure compliance with the instructions.

Results and Discussion
Participants’ order reconstruction (calculated as mean proportion of items in the correct order) was more accurate on dissimilar
(.75) than similar (.61) lists, the typical result. This pattern was
confirmed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), F(1, 99) ⫽ 101.89,
MSE ⫽ 0.052, p ⬍ .05. The mean PSE was .169 (lower quartile ⫽
.068; median ⫽ .178; upper quartile ⫽ .273; SD ⫽ .195; range ⫽
⫺.833 to .625), and the distribution did not differ from normal
(Kolmogorov–Smirnov Z ⫽ 0.815, ns). Seven participants performed more accurately on similar than dissimilar words, and 9
showed no difference.

BRIEF REPORTS

Simulation results are based on 20 runs per pseudo-subject, half
with dissimilar and half with similar items, just as with the real
participants. Phonological similarity was modeled by setting a
random subset of the features to equal values, just as in previous
simulations (e.g., Nairne, 1990; Neath, 2000). A full listing of
parameters is shown in the Appendix.
Two types of models were compared. For the “mean” model, all
parameters were identical for all pseudo-subjects. Any variability
in output is due entirely to the particular random processes within
the feature model. In contrast, the “variance” model reflects the
observation that different participants vary in their overall level of
performance. In the feature model, this is captured by the
attention–scaling parameter a. This parameter was initially set to
the same starting value for each pseudo-subject but was then
increased (or decreased) by an amount determined by sampling
randomly from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a
standard deviation of four. The resulting value was then used for
all simulation runs for that particular pseudo-subject.1
Figure 1 compares the fits of the two models to various aspects
of the data.2 Although both models simulated the main effect
(upper panel) and both the proportion PSE and proportion of the
sample who showed a reversed effect (lower panel), the mean

model shows insufficient variability (the upper panel shows standard deviation, the lower panel shows standard error), whereas the
variance model shows adequate variability.
One way to test the extent to which the feature model is really
capturing the data is to examine performance in the upper and
lower quartiles (see Figure 2). Participants in the upper quartile in
the dissimilar condition show the greatest PSE (.21) and the fewest
reversals (.04); those in the lower quartile show the smallest PSE
(.11) and the most reversals (.24). The results from the variance
model (also shown in Figure 2) show the same pattern.
Finally, it is possible to break the simulation and experimental
results down still further and report the data by serial position for
each group and each condition. These are shown in Figure 3.
Although the ordering of the conditions and the amount of variance are appropriate, the model does not produce sufficiently
bowed curves.
The experimental results confirm the basic finding of Logie et
al. (1996) that not all apparently “normal” participants show the
standard PSE and also provide evidence that variation in the size
of the PSE is best described by a normal distribution. This latter
finding is what would be expected on the basis of nonstrategic
between-participant differences; an account based on two different
encoding strategies (phonological and nonphonological) would
predict a bimodal distribution. The data go further, however, in
indicating that interindividual variation in the size of the PSE is
directly attributable to variation in immediate memory capabilities
rather than the operation of chance factors. One failing of the
model, however, is the insufficient curvature of the serial position
curve, particularly in the phonologically similar condition for the
top-performing quartile (see Figure 3).

The parameter a was set to 10 in the mean model and 13.5 in the

performance constant.

As in other simulations with the feature model (e.g., Nairne, 1990;
Neath, 1999, 2000; Neath & Nairne, 1995; Neath & Surprenant, 2007),
there is no attempt to obtain the best possible quantitative fits. Rather, the
goal is to show the correct qualitative pattern of results by changing only
those parameters associated with the particular psychological processes
implicated. Specifically, we adjusted the model to match the overall
performance correct in the “standard” condition (i.e., dissimilar or short)
and then examined the rest of the model’s predictions.

shown in uppercase for 1 s in the middle of the window on a
computer screen in 24-point Helvetica font. The list length was
eight, and thus eight response buttons were used. Participants
received 40 lists, half with short and half with long items. The
order of short and long trials was randomly determined for each
participant.

Results and Discussion
Participants correctly recalled in order more short words (.48)
than long words (.40), indicating that the word-length manipulation was successful, as confirmed by ANOVA, F(1, 99) ⫽ 103.7,
MSE ⫽ 9.30, p ⬍ .05. The mean WLE was .16 (lower quartile ⫽
.060; median ⫽ .158; upper quartile ⫽ .284; SD ⫽ .162; range ⫽
⫺.30 to .55), and the distribution did not differ from normal
(Kolmogorov–Smirnov Z ⫽ 0.428, ns). Thirteen participants
showed a reversal, and 3 showed no effect.
Pseudo-subjects were presented with the same number and
structure of lists. The length manipulation was simulated as in
previous work (e.g., Neath & Nairne, 1995, pp. 432– 433). It was
assumed that short words consisted of a single segment, long
words had seven segments, and the probability of a segment error
was .10 for both word lengths. Individual variation was modeled as
in Experiment 1. A full listing of parameters is shown in the
Appendix.

223

Figure 4 shows the results of separate simulation runs of sets of
pseudo-subjects, using the same procedure as Experiment 1.
Again, good fits were obtained for both the mean and variance
models, with the latter better reproducing the amount of variability
seen in the data.
We again examined how overall performance level affects the
appearance of the WLE by once again comparing the upper and
lower quartile of the human participants and pseudo-subjects.
Figure 5 shows that like the PSE in the previous experiment, there
is a trend toward a larger WLE (.19) and fewer reversals (.04) in
the better performing group and a smaller WLE (.13) and more
reversals (.16) in the lower performing group in both the data and
in the predictions of the model. It is important to note that this
pattern, predicted by the model, was not obvious a priori.
Serial position curves for the two groups are shown in Figure 6.
This figure demonstrates that the model again underpredicts the
curvature of the serial position curve. Table 1 summarizes the
distribution of PSE and WLE reversals in the experimental and
simulation data from the variance model.
The results of this study reveal a similar pattern of effect by
performance interaction with word length as appeared for phonological similarity. This relationship also held for the simulation
model, despite the different loci for the two effects within the
model. In Experiment 2, which made use of longer list lengths, the
failure of the model to produce the appropriate degree of serial
position curvature was also more noticeable, in particular the lack
of primacy over the first two serial positions.

General Discussion
The two experiments reported here confirm that the general
pattern of results within Logie et al.’s (1996) span data are replicable when the procedure is changed to one more commonly used
in immediate memory experiments. A sizable minority of participants either failed to show or showed reverse PSEs and WLEs.
These zero and negative effects were, nonetheless, predicted by a
model designed to show detrimental effects of phonological similarity and word length. Furthermore, the model successfully accounts for these data and other measures of variability within the
data without any qualitative changes in its operation. Previously, it
has been suggested that a diminished PSE or WLE reflects a
change in strategy (e.g., lack of rehearsal; Baddeley & Larsen,
2007; Logie et al., 1996) or a move to a different form of storage
(Baddeley, 2000). This line of reasoning is also used in the
neuropsychological literature to relate memory processes to structure (e.g., Silveri et al., 1998). The simulations reported here
demonstrate that a merely quantitative change is sufficient to
produce such variation in both effect sizes, with the PSE and WSE
being associated with high performance levels. However, two
potential criticisms might be leveled at the current study. The first
is that the simulations fit only statistical noise and, as such, are
both (a) theoretically uninteresting and (b) not unique to the model
we describe. The second criticism is that any model can provide a
better fit to the data if another parameter is provided and that the
current simulations do little more than demonstrate this fact.

Random Variation and Post Hoc Parameter Fitting

dence of null and reverse effects also results if both interindividual
and intraindividual variations are provided by the randomly fluctuating values generated for the feature vectors. This reinforces the central
message of this study, that strategy change is not necessary to account
for reduction in the PSE and the WLE. In actuality, however, one

would expect some reliable difference in performance between Participant A and Participant B, which requires manipulation of a parameter between pseudo-subjects, as reported for the simulations
accompanying Experiments 1 and 2, to provide the necessary intraindividual consistency. There is, however, a complication.

Figure 4. Experiment 2: Fits of a systematic variation of between-participant differences to the experimental
data. The upper panel shows the best fits to mean and variance, calculated independently. Error bars show
standard deviation, to emphasize this. The lower panel shows the proportion of word length effects (WLEs)
calculated according to Equation 8 and the proportion of the sample showing reversals—superior performance
on long word lists. All data are taken from the simulation runs that produced the results shown in the upper panel.
Error bars show standard error.

As the correlation between components of a difference increases
(such as when the component scores are provided by the same
individual or dependent on the same parameter within a pseudosubject), the intraindividual reliability of the difference score itself
decreases (Johns, 1981; Peter, Churchill, & Brown, 1993). Ironically, the observation of an association at the interindividual level
between memory performance and effect size is the feature that
could potentially cast doubt on the reliability of the intraindividual
association. The model as reported clearly shows attenuated effects
among low ability pseudo-subjects. However, because of the relatively small number of data points per individual in the experimental data it is unrealistic to test, at an intraindividual level, the
reliability of the link between memory ability and PSEs and
WLEs. Despite this shortcoming, and as noted earlier, a relation
between memory ability and memory effects at either intraindividual or interindividual levels militates against the suggestion that
reductions in the PSE and the WLE are necessarily consequences

of altered strategy— unless that strategy can be shown to be the
most effective of any adopted. The feature model provides an
alternative, and arguably more parsimonious, mechanism, but further research is clearly necessary to fully test the viability of this
alternative mechanism.
The next points to consider are whether the predictions of the
feature model are unique to that model, and whether it accounts for
the data by something other than post hoc parameter fitting. It is
possible that many models could account for variation within an
experimental sample. However, no such results have yet been
reported, and it is incumbent on those who wish to claim that their
models produce the appropriate distributions to demonstrate that
interindividual variation is within their capabilities. The more
serious point is whether a model of quantitative variation accounts
for the systematic relationship between memory ability and the
effect sizes in any theoretically satisfying way. The simulations of
the feature model show that the PSE and the WLE are expected to

vary as a function of quantitative changes in participants’ abilities,
a prediction that was confirmed by examination of the experimental data. But is this a unique feature of the model or a piece of post
hoc parameter fitting?
The fit to the mean and variance scores from our participant
samples (upper panels of Figures 1 and 5) were produced by a set
of parameters appropriate to the performance levels observed
within the experimental data set. Crucially, the subsequent splitting of the samples into high- and low-performance quartiles was
carried out only after these parameters had been determined and
were not free to vary. All simulation results beyond this point
(Figures 2, 3, 5, and 6 and the lower panels of Figures 1 and 4)
comprise a novel, and genuine, prediction of a positive relationship
between memory capability and PSEs and WLEs. The reason for
this pattern, which was not obvious prior to simulation, is the
specific role of the attention parameter in magnifying the distance
score between mismatches and potential matches (Equation 1).
The attention parameter was used to simulate interindividual vari-

ation because it is the only parameter within the model that varies
over all performance levels to a significant degree and hence is the
only viable source of systematic interindividual variation.3 Varying this factor between individuals is a necessary requirement to
enable systematic interindividual differences, but the factor was
neither new nor free to vary once an appropriate distribution of
effect sizes was established. The implication for high- and lowperformance subgroups represented a real, and potentially falsifiable, prediction that was, however, confirmed when tested against
experimental data. It is not clear that varying a single parameter
within other models would, of necessity, produce the same pattern
of results, although this can be definitively determined only by
extensive simulation studies (by varying the threshold, the primacy
gradient, or the level of Gaussian noise within the primacy model;
e.g., see Page & Norris, 1998). It is also unclear what parameters

might provide a theoretically motivated basis for interindividual
differences (as the choice of potential parameters within the primacy model example indicates) or whether it would be necessary
to vary different parameters independently to replicate the memory
by effect interactions for PSEs and WLEs. In experimental terms,
a single quantitative variable within the model we examined necessarily alters the pattern of immediate memory effects observed
and is by itself sufficient to cause a qualitative shift in the appearance of PSEs and WLEs. This observation has a number of
implications.
Generally, it suggests that purely quantitative variations in some
performance factor at either intraindividual or interindividual levels could frequently appear within the experimental data as qualitative shifts in performance characteristics. This reinforces the
idea that quantitative computational simulations are a productive
method for testing (often implicit) theoretical assumptions that
might otherwise go unchallenged or unrecognized (Lewandowsky,
1993). More specifically, the results imply that neither a shift in
rehearsal patterns nor the deployment of particular storage buffers
(Baddeley & Larsen, 2007) is necessary to explain reductions in

the WLE and the PSE among individuals undertaking immediate
memory tasks. The feature model predicts both effects using a
single PM and no maintenance rehearsal. It is not possible to
convincingly show an absence of strategy, so it is incumbent on
those who would support the strategy shift idea to show why it is
needed to account for differences in effect size. Our data, and that
of Logie et al. (1996), show that most, if not all, of the variation in
effect sizes can be accounted for directly on the basis of performance characteristics rather than indirectly by performance-based
strategy shifts.
