The Sunny Side of Fairness
Preference for Fairness Activates Reward Circuitry (and
Disregarding Unfairness Activates Self-Control Circuitry)

ABSTRACT—Little

is known about the positive emotional
impact of fairness or the process of resolving conflict between fairness and financial interests. In past research,
fairness has covaried with monetary payoff, such that the
mental processes underlying preference for fairness and
those underlying preference for greater monetary outcome
could not be distinguished. We examined self-reported happiness and neural responses to fair and unfair offers while
controlling for monetary payoff. Compared with unfair
offers of equal monetary value, fair offers led to higher
happiness ratings and activation in several reward regions
of the brain. Furthermore, the tendency to accept unfair
proposals was associated with increased activity in right
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, a region involved in emotion regulation, and with decreased activity in the anterior
insula, which has been implicated in negative affect. This
work provides evidence that fairness is hedonically valued
and that tolerating unfair treatment for material gain
involves a pattern of activation resembling suppression of
negative affect.
Anyone who has watched children negotiate how to share a piece
of cake knows that humans are exquisitely sensitive to fairness.
Although economic models of decision making have traditionally assumed that individuals are motivated solely by material
utility (e.g., financial payouts) and are not directly affected by
social factors such as fairness (Camerer, Loewenstein, & Prelec,
2005; Kahneman, Knetsch, & Thaler, 1986), there is increasing
empirical evidence that fairness does play a role in economic
decision making (Fehr & Schmidt, 1999; Sears & Funk, 1991).
Fairness in economic-exchange tasks is typically defined as
the equitable distribution of an initial stake of money between
two people. Because fair outcomes tend to be more materially

desirable for the recipient than unfair outcomes in everyday life,
it is difficult to distinguish the desire for fairness from the desire
for material gain. Bilateral bargaining games, such as the ultimatum game, allow these two potential motives to be examined
separately. The results of studies using the ultimatum game indicate that people are sensitive to fairness over and above its consequences for material gain (Güth, Schmittberger, & Schwarze,
1982). Although there is evidence that receiving an unfair proposal is associated with negative emotional responses (Sanfey,
Rilling, Aronson, Nystrom, & Cohen, 2003), no study on economic
decision making has examined whether a fair proposal produces
positive emotional responses beyond those associated with the
material gain itself.
To examine the emotional response associated with fair
treatment, we conducted two ultimatum-game experiments. In
this game, one player proposes how to split a given sum of money,
the stake, and another player responds. If the responder accepts,
each player keeps the amount allocated by the proposer. If the
responder rejects the offer, neither player receives any money.
Numerous studies using the ultimatum game have shown that
responders do not maximize material utility by accepting every
offer, but rather tend to reject offers below 20% of the stake
(Camerer & Thaler, 1995), even when there will be no future
interactions with the partner (Güth et al., 1982).
In a neuroimaging study of the ultimatum game, Sanfey et al.
(2003) observed that being treated unfairly is associated with
a negative emotional response, inferred from anterior insula
activation. They did not report what regions were more active
during fair than during unfair offers. Furthermore, because fair
offers (i.e., $5 out of $10) were always associated with higher
monetary payoff than unfair offers (e.g., $2 out of $10), it is
difficult to dissociate emotional response to fairness from emotional response to monetary payoff in their study. Hence, it is
unclear from these data whether fair treatment is rewarding, in
addition to unfair treatment being aversive.
Research on social justice suggests that seeking justice is a
basic human impulse (i.e., the justice motive; Tyler, 1991), possibly rooted in a basic social motivation to be accepted (Bau-

meister & Leary, 1995). Perceived fair treatment from public
institutions (e.g., court, police) has been associated with satisfaction beyond the effects of the material outcomes, such as
sentencing (Tyler, 1984). Critically, studies examining the impact of fairness on positive and negative emotions separately,
controlling for material outcomes, have found substantial increases in self-rated positive emotions associated with fair treatment (De Cremer & Alberts, 2004; Hegtvedt & Killian, 1999).
If being treated fairly is experienced as rewarding, then
people should be happier with a fair offer than with an unfair
offer of the same monetary value. Similarly, brain regions associated with reward should be more active during fair than
during unfair treatment, after controlling for material utility.
These reward regions include the ventral striatum, the amygdala,
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and midbrain dopamine regions (Cardinal, Parkinson, Hall, & Everitt, 2002; Trepel, Fox, & Poldrack, 2005).
Although the amygdala has commonly been associated with fear
processes, activity in this structure, particularly on the left, has
also been associated with reward processes (Hommer et al.,
2003; Zalla et al., 2000).
In order to control for material utility, we varied both the offer
amount and the stake size across trials (see Fig. 1). On different
trials, the same offer amount could represent a large percentage
of the total stake (e.g., $7 out of $15), and therefore seem fair, or
a small percentage of the total stake (e.g., $7 out of $23), and
therefore seem unfair. Differences in ratings of happiness or
reward activations observed in the comparison of such trials
cannot be attributed to the magnitude of the monetary reward
and thus are reasonably attributed to fairness.

Fig. 1. Illustration of the manipulation of material utility and fairness.
In the analysis of fairness preference, trials of equal material utility were
divided according to fairness (i.e., the ratio of the offer to the stake). In
this example, the offers in the top row are high-fairness offers, and those
in the bottom row are low-fairness offers, and each of two monetary
outcomes is presented in both a high-fairness offer and a low-fairness
offer. Across trials, high- and low-fairness offers had the same average
material utility.

We also examined neural response during trials in which
fairness and material outcome were at odds—that is, trials
on which the offers were unfair but financially desirable (e.g.,
$8 out of $23). Thus, we examined the neural correlates of
the tendency to accept unfair offers. Two possibilities were investigated. First, accepted unfair offers may activate reward
circuitry to a greater extent than rejected unfair offers; such a
pattern would reflect enhanced desire to accept the offers. Second, emotion regulation may be engaged when unfair offers are
accepted, which would diminish the anterior insula’s response
and decrease the desire to reject the offer. In this case, one would
expect decreased activity in the anterior insula and increased
activity in a prefrontal region that has been associated with
emotion regulation, such as the right ventrolateral prefrontal
cortex (right VLPFC; Hariri, Bookheimer, & Mazziotta, 2000;
Lieberman et al., 2007).
Participants in our studies played the role of responder. In
Experiment 1, we measured emotional responses to each offer by
obtaining self-ratings of happiness and contempt. In Experiment
2, we measured neural responses to fair and unfair offers using
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants
were told that their decisions regarding four randomly selected
offers in the experiment would actually be implemented, such
that they and the proposers of those offers would be paid or not,
according to the responses.

EXPERIMENT 1

Method
Participants and Task
Twenty-nine undergraduates (average age 5 20.1 years; 18 females, 11 males) participated after replying to a flyer indicating
that they could earn up to $52 for participation. They were told
that the proposers had submitted their offers already and would
not be present. Actually, there were no real proposers. During
the experiment, each offer was presented as follows (see Fig. 2):
First, participants were shown the purported proposer. Then, the
stake was indicated, followed by the offer. While the offer was
displayed, participants could accept or reject it. After the experiment, all participants were debriefed, paid a total of $27,
and entered in a lottery in which 4 participants were selected to
receive an additional $25. Thus, all participants had a chance of
winning ‘‘up to $52,’’ as advertised. Offers ranged from 5% to
50% of the total stake size, and stakes ranged from $1 to $30. We
selected particular offer values and then matched each with two
stake sizes in order to obtain one low and one high ratio of offer to
stake size.
Measures
After playing the game, participants were asked to rate (1–7)
how much happiness and contempt they felt in response to each
of a preselected subset of 28 offers. This subset consisted of 14

matched with $2 out of $10). In this subset of offers, the ratio of
offer to stake size ranged from 5 to 50% (average 5 28%); the
stakes ranged from $1 to $30 (average 5 $12.18).
Results
Fairness Predicts Happiness, Independently of Contempt
Happiness ratings were strongly associated with fairness (i.e.,
percentage of the stake size offered). Participants reported
greater happiness for fair offers ( 40%) than unfair offers
( 20%) of equal monetary value, t(13) 5 7.73, prep > .99,
d 5 4.29. Similarly, there was a strong correlation between level
of fairness and happiness ratings (r 5 .89, prep > .99). A complementary pattern was observed for contempt ratings. Participants reported greater contempt for unfair offers than for
fair offers of equal monetary value, t(13) 5 5.51, prep > .99,
d 5 3.06, and there was a strong correlation between level of
fairness and contempt ratings (r 5 .82, prep > .99).
Given that happiness and contempt were correlated (r 5 .82,
prep > .99), we examined the effect of fairness on happiness

however, contempt controlling for happiness (CH̄ ), was not (r 5

Fairness Predicts Happiness, Independently of Material Outcome
Offer amount and emotion ratings were not strongly associated.
Happiness ratings of high-value offers (> $2) did not differ from
those of low-value offers ( $2) of equal fairness, t(13) 5 1.16,
prep 5 .87, d 5 0.64. Although the correlation between offer
amount and happiness was marginally significant (r 5 .32,
prep > .95), offer amount did not predict HC (r 5 .28, prep > .92).
Similarly, contempt ratings of high-value offers did not differ
from those of low-value offers of equal fairness, t(13) 5 0.39,
prep 5 .60, d 5 0.15. The correlations between offer amount and
contempt (r 5 .20, prep 5 .85) and between offer amount and
CH̄ (r 5 .11, prep 5 .71) were not significant.
After controlling for the effect of offer amount, fairness still
predicted happiness (b 5 .87, prep > .99) and HC (b 5 .35,
prep > .95), and fairness still predicted contempt (b 5 .81,
prep > .99), but not CH (b 5 .18, prep 5 .82). Together, these
results indicate that fairness, independently of offer amount,
predicts happiness, independently of contempt.

EXPERIMENT 2

Method
Participants and Task
Twelve undergraduates (average age 5 21.8 years; 9 females, 3
males) participated. The task was similar to that in Experiment
1, except that the stakes ranged from $1 to $23 (average 5
$9.60), and participants underwent fMRI scanning while they
considered the offers. After the scanning session, participants
indicated what they considered a fair offer for each stake size.
fMRI Acquisition and Analysis
Data were acquired on a GE 3-T full-body scanner. Scanning
parameters were identical to those used in our previous studies
(see Lieberman, Jarcho, & Satpute, 2004). Each of four functional scans consisted of thirty-one 6-s trials, as well as five 6-s
jitter trials. The MR data were analyzed using SPM99 (Wellcome
Department of Cognitive Neurology, London). Images for each
participant were realigned, slice-timed, normalized to Montreal
Neurological Institute (MNI) space, and smoothed with an 8-mm
Gaussian kernel, full width at half maximum.
We included in the fairness analysis only matched pairs of
trials in which the same amount was accepted in one case and
rejected in the other. Thus, we analyzed neural activation in response to offers that possessed matched financial rewards and
therefore differed primarily in their perceived fairness.
Events were modeled with a canonical hemodynamic response function time-locked with the onset of the offer.1 Linear
contrasts were employed to assess comparisons of interest within
individual participants. Random-effects analyses of the group
were computed using the contrast images generated for each
participant. For regions of interest, significance was set using an
uncorrected p value of .005 (5-voxel threshold). Post hoc analyses were carried out at a p value of .001 (20-voxel threshold).
Peristimulus hemodynamic time courses were computed by
identifying clusters of activations from the random-effects
analyses and then applying to these clusters a selective averaging procedure on a participant-by-participant basis (Poldrack, 2004). Regression analysis of the tendency to accept unfair
offers was conducted by performing a group analysis in which
each participant’s rate of accepting unfair offers was entered as a
regressor to identify which activations correlated with the rate.
Results
Behavioral Results
On average, participants accepted 56.3% (SD 5 12.3%) of all
the offers in the experiment, a result indicating that they were
not solely motivated by monetary reward, in which case they

would have accepted all offers. This acceptance rate decreased
significantly (prep > .95) as the proportion of the offer relative to
the stake size decreased (see Table 1). Across all trials in the
study, multiple participants rejected offers as financially desirable as $8 out of $23; on average, participants rejected at least
one offer as high as $4.88.
Self-Report Results
Average self-reported estimates of what constituted a fair offer
ranged from 45.2% to 48.3% across stakes. For each participant, we calculated the percentage of unfair offers (as identified
by the participant’s own responses after the scanning session)
that were accepted. On average, participants accepted 49.0% of
the offers that were below their self-reported fairness thresholds.
These results suggest that although participants were influenced
by fairness, they were sometimes able to overcome or disregard
fairness considerations and make the economically normative
decision when fairness and material considerations were at
odds.
fMRI Results: Fairness Preference
Several brain regions associated with reward processes were
more active during high-fairness offers than during low-fairness
offers, after controlling for material utility. Brain regions that
showed greater activity for high- than for low-fairness offers
were the ventral striatum, the amygdala, VMPFC, OFC, and a
midbrain region near the substantia nigra (see Table 2 and Fig.
3). A post hoc whole-brain analysis also revealed sensitivity to
increased fairness in lateral temporal cortex (x 5 44, y 5 18,
z 5 24), t(11) 5 4.74, prep > .99, d 5 2.86.
In the high- versus low-fairness contrast, participants producing greater activity in the ventral striatum, compared with
other participants, tended to produce greater activity in the
amygdala (r 5 .81, prep > .95) and VMPFC (r 5 .65, prep > .95)
as well. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that the
ventral striatum, the amygdala, and VMPFC function together as
a motivational circuit related to reward (Trepel et al., 2005).
We examined whether the reward activations could be attributed to a continuation of effects occurring during the first
half of each trial, when the face and stake size were presented,
prior to when the offer was presented and a choice was made. We

fMRI Results: Accepting Unfair Offers
Our findings for the anterior insula are consistent with those of
Sanfey et al. (2003). Specifically, we observed increased anterior
insula activity (relative to a resting baseline) during idiographically defined unfair trials that were rejected (x 5 36, y 5 18,
z 5 8), t(11) 5 4.39, prep > .99, d 5 2.95. We also examined
the neural structures activated when responders overcame fairness concerns and accepted offers they considered unfair. The
hypothesis that accepted unfair offers activate reward circuitry to a
greater extent than rejected unfair offers was not supported by the
data. There was no activity in the ventral striatum, the amygdala, or
VMPFC (at a liberal statistical threshold of p < .01 uncorrected)
when accepted unfair offers were compared with resting baseline.
However, a large cluster (k 5 834) in right VLPFC was active in
this comparison (x 5 50, y 5 44, z 5 8), t(11) 5 5.39, prep > .99,

d 5 3.25, a finding consistent with the hypothesis that accepting
unfair offers may involve emotion regulation.
To further explore the involvement of right VLPFC and the
anterior insula in decisions regarding unfair offers, we specifically compared trials in which unfair offers were accepted with
trials in which unfair offers were rejected. As expected, the left
anterior insula was less active when unfair offers were accepted
than when they were rejected (x 5 28, y 5 8, z 5 6), t(11) 5
4.06, prep > .99, d 5 2.45. Activity in this insula region was
inversely correlated with right VLPFC activity (x 5 58, y 5 34,
z 5 10) during trials in which unfair offers were accepted
(r 5 .77, prep > .99), a finding consistent with the hypothesis
that right VLPFC reduces insula activity in such cases.
We also examined the rate at which participants accepted
offers they rated unfair in the postscanning questionnaire, regressing this index onto brain activations in the contrast of

344

accepted versus rejected offers. As Figure 4 shows, participants
who accepted a higher proportion of idiographically defined
unfair offers showed a greater increase in activity in right
VLPFC (x 5 50, y 5 24, z 5 8), t(11) 5 3.68, prep > .99, d 5
2.22, and a greater decrease in activity in the anterior insula on
the left (x 5 34, y 5 20, z 5 6), t(11) 5 7.59, prep > .99,
d 5 4.58, and right (x 5 32, y 5 22, z 5 10), t(11) 5 6.01,
prep > .99, d 5 3.62, during trials in which offers were accepted
relative to trials in which offers were rejected. Furthermore,
activity in right VLPFC was again inversely correlated with
activity in the left (r 5 .68, prep > .99) and right (r 5 .86,
prep > .99) anterior insula. No activity in the ventral striatum, the
amygdala, or VMPFC was positively correlated with the tendency to accept unfair offers. These findings suggest a prefrontal
down-regulation of negative emotional responses during the
process of accepting unfair offers.

If right VLPFC is involved in the acceptance of unfair offers
by reducing negative affect associated with the anterior insula,
then the relationship between right VLPFC activity and the rate
of accepting unfair offers should be mediated by activity in the
anterior insula. Indeed, the direct path between right VLPFC
activity and the rate of accepting unfair offers (b 5 .76, prep >
.99) was significantly mediated by activity in the left anterior
insula (Sobel test: Z 5 2.51, prep > .99). After we controlled for
activity in this insula region, the remaining path between
VLPFC activity and the rate of accepting unfair offers was no
longer significant (b 5 .25, prep 5 .94).
DISCUSSION

Experiment 1 demonstrated that fairness, but not monetary value,
predicted self-reported happiness independently of contempt
ratings. In Experiment 2, nearly all commonly identified reward
areas, including the ventral striatum, the amygdala, VMPFC, and
OFC, were associated with fairness preference. Together, these
results suggest that individuals react to fairness with a positive
hedonic response, rather than that fairness produces a neutral
state and only unfairness produces an affective response. These
results are consistent with previous reports that reward regions
such as the striatum, VMPFC, and the amygdala are responsive to
cooperative partners and behavior (King-Casas et al., 2005;
Rilling et al., 2002; Singer, Kiebel, Winston, Dolan, & Frith,
2004). Further, these results suggest that fairness processing is
relatively automatic and intuitive, as the ventral striatum, the
amygdala, and VMPFC have all been associated with automatic
and intuitive processes (Lieberman, 2007).
In previous studies of the ultimatum game, fairness and material utility have covaried. Typical offers in these studies have
been either completely fair and of highest material utility (e.g.,
$5 out of $10), and therefore easily accepted, or very unfair and
of lowest material utility (e.g., $1 out of $10), and therefore
usually rejected. However, in real life there are situations in
which the choice is less straightforward. In the current study, we
manipulated conflict-ridden choices by presenting offers that
were of considerable material utility but relatively unfair (e.g.,
$8 out of $23).
To the extent that a participant produced increased activity in
right VLPFC and decreased activity in the anterior insula, the
participant was more likely to accept unfair but financially desirable offers. One interpretation of this result is that participants who accepted unfair offers were better able than others to
down-regulate the negative emotional response to unfair treatment. Alternatively, increased activity in anterior insula could
reflect the ‘‘pain of paying’’ associated with rejecting an offer
(Knutson, Rick, Wimmer, Prelec, & Loewenstein, 2007), rather
than the social pain of unfair treatment. Thus, participants who
were more likely to accept unfair offers may have had lower
insula activity because they experienced little pain of paying.
However, the overall pattern of results involving right VLPFC is

Volume 19—Number 4

more consistent with the former interpretation. Activity in the
insula mediated the relationship between right VLPFC activity
and tendency to accept unfair offers, and this finding supports
the hypothesis that right VLPFC promotes more normative decision making by down-regulating activity in the anterior insula
when unfair offers are considered. Thus, the ability to swallow
one’s pride, overcome the insult, and take an unfair offer may
involve active down-regulation of emotional responses to unfair
treatment.
Consistent with the idea that right VLPFC activity drove participants’ decisions to accept unfair offers, studies using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have identified
the right lateral prefrontal cortex as playing a causal role in rational decision making in the ultimatum game (Knoch, PascualLeone, Meyer, Treyer, & Fehr, 2006; van’t Wout, Kahn, Sanfey, &
Aleman, 2005). Interestingly, in the current study, accepted
unfair offers were not associated with increased activity in reward-related regions, which supports the interpretation that
logical rather than hedonic processes guided these particular
decisions. In the two rTMS studies, transient disruption of
function in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (right DLPFC)
interfered with rejection of unfair offers. Although the dorsolateral region identified in these studies is structurally and functionally distinct from the VLPFC region identified in the current
study, these findings together are consistent with the notion (van’t
Wout et al., 2005) that the default response in the ultimatum
game is to reject an unfair offer; DLPFC may be needed
to maintain this default goal, whereas VLPFC may be needed to
override it. An alternative interpretation is that DLPFC may
be needed to override material self-interest (Knoch et al., 2006),
as the role of VLPFC may be to override fairness concerns.
In previous studies, right VLPFC has consistently been associated with the down-regulation of activity in regions supporting negative affect (Lieberman, in press). Specifically, it has
been associated with the down-regulation of the amygdala’s
response to pictures of disturbing scenes (Hariri, Mattay, Tessitore, Fera, & Weinberger, 2003) and pictures of evocative faces
(Hariri et al., 2000; Lieberman et al., 2007; Lieberman, Hariri,
Jarcho, Eisenberger, & Bookheimer, 2005), as well as the downregulation of the anterior cingulate’s response to physical (Lieberman, Jarcho, Berman, et al., 2004; Wager et al., 2004) and
social (Eisenberger, Lieberman, & Williams, 2003) pain. Right
VLPFC has also been linked to reduced susceptibility to
amygdala-mediated framing effects and thus to rational decision
making (De Martino, Kumaran, Seymour, & Dolan, 2006). Thus,
it is plausible that in the current study, right VLPFC downregulated affect-related activity in the anterior insula to enable
the rational decision of accepting an unfair offer.
The fact that we did not find any region exhibiting greater
activity for low-fairness offers than for high-fairness offers
seems at odds with the results of Sanfey et al. (2003), who reported greater activity in anterior insula and prefrontal areas
during unfair than during fair offers. It is possible that the differ-

Fairness Is Rewarding

ences in results are due to differences in the experimental designs, such as the use of rapid versus slow event-related designs
or the types of fair and unfair trials used. Nonetheless, in both
investigations, increased insula activity correlated with the tendency to reject unfair offers, so the studies converge on similar
functional interpretations of insula activity.
One may wonder whether the reward activations observed in
the fairness-preference analysis were in response to fairness per
se or were actually due to the perceived higher probability of
receiving the monetary offer in fair trials (which were accepted)
than in unfair trials (which were rejected). Although our data
cannot fully rule out the latter interpretation, it is unlikely. If
greater expectation of monetary payoff was driving reward activity during high-fairness trials in Experiment 2, we should
have found reward activity during acceptance of unfair offers,
which had the same perceived probability of payoff as the accepted fair offers. However, activation during accepted unfair
offers was not greater than baseline activation in any rewardrelated regions, which suggests that the increased activity in
these regions during high-fairness trials was not driven by the
perceived probability of monetary payoff.
Finally, the relatively early onset of activity in the amygdala
(see Fig. 3c) suggests that this response may have been both
related to the offer and a continuation of response from the first
half of the trial. However, we did not find significant amygdala
activation in a whole-brain analysis of the first half of the trial,
even at a lenient threshold (prep > .99, uncorrected). The discrepancy between this null result and the apparent time course
of amygdala activation in Figure 3c reflects the fact that wholebrain analyses examine the correlation between the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent response and the canonical hemodynamic response, and do not show effects at any one time point.
Despite the absence of significant amygdala activation in this
analysis, however, it is difficult to infer that the amygdala activity reported here reflects reward processing per se, as such
activity has also been observed in numerous studies of negatively valenced information processing. However, when amygdala activity co-occurs with activity in VMPFC and ventral
striatum, it is commonly in the context of reward processing
(Cardinal et al., 2002; Petrovich, Holland, & Gallagher, 2005;
Trepel et al., 2005). Our confidence in the inference that the
amygdala response is related to reward processing is increased
because of (a) the convergence of evidence from self-report and
(b) the fact that this response was observed in the context of
the activation of multiple regions that work together in a network underlying reward processing (Poldrack, 2006). Future
studies are needed to elucidate the role of the amygdala in social
reward.
In conclusion, these findings suggest that people may prefer
fair outcomes at the cost of material utility in part because they
hedonically value fairness itself; this preference may not be
motivated solely by negative emotional responses to unfairness
or by the impersonal application of culture-driven rules.

346

Moreover, when material utility outweighs social utility, people
may down-regulate their affect-related neural response to unfair
treatment in order to choose the economically desirable option.
These results support the notion that the automatic or default
reaction in economic decision making is to prefer the fair and
refuse the unfair (van’t Wout et al., 2005), not just because fair
options also tend to be materially advantageous or because
unfairness is jarring, but also because fair treatment can be
rewarding in itself.
