ABSTRACT—A photograph of an action can convey a vivid
sense of motion. Does the inference of motion from viewing a
photograph involve the same neural and psychological
representations used when one views physical motion? In
this study, we tested whether implied motion is represented
by the same direction-selective signals involved in the perception of real motion. We made use of the motion aftereffect, a visual motion illusion. Three experiments showed
that viewing a series of static photographs with implied
motion in a particular direction produced motion aftereffects in the opposite direction, as assessed with real-motion test probes. The transfer of adaptation from motion
depicted in photographs to real motion demonstrates that
the perception of implied motion activates direction-selective circuits that are also involved in processing real motion.

Humans quickly and efﬁciently extract motion information from
a wide range of stimuli in the environment. Even visual stimuli
that do not contain motion but only imply it, such as frozenmotion photographs, lead to the rapid and automatic extrapolation of motion paths (Freyd, 1983). For example, in the top
photograph in Figure 1a, it is easy to see a sprinter running to the
left. The sense of motion must be inferred from prior knowledge;
there is, of course, no physical motion in the photograph. Such
stimuli would appear to have little in common with the drifting
dots and gratings commonly used to study neural mechanisms of
motion processing, other than the fact that the observer knows
that both types of stimuli depict motion in some sense. In the
study reported here, we investigated how the sense of motion
from static photographs is represented in the visual system.
The primate brain contains a number of visual areas involved
in the analysis of moving objects and patterns (Maunsell &
Newsome, 1987; Tootell et al., 1995). Such areas contain neurons that respond to moving images in a direction-selective

manner (Dubner & Zeki, 1971; Heeger, Boynton, Demb,
Seidemann, & Newsome, 1999; Huk, Ress, & Heeger, 2001).
The direction of motion, however, may be inferred not just from
the analysis of visual motion, but also from low-level visual form
cues, such as motion streaks (Burr & Ross, 2002; Geisler, 1999),
or from higher-level cues, such as the posture of a person in
motion (as in the photo of the sprinter in Fig. 1a). Is the sense of
motion derived from such static cues instantiated by the same
neural and psychological mechanisms that subserve the perception of physical motion? In particular, we sought to test
whether viewing implied-motion images recruits the same direction-selective neural circuitry used for the perception of real
visual motion. For example, does viewing the still photograph of
the sprinter in Figure 1a elicit responses from the same leftwardselective neurons that would respond during the perception of
real leftward motion?
Neuroimaging studies have shown that brain areas used to
analyze physical motion are also activated by viewing impliedmotion stimuli (Kourtzi & Kanwisher, 2000; Lorteije et al.,
2006; Peuskens, Vanrie, Verfaillie, & Orban, 2005; Senior et al.,
2000). In these studies, visual motion areas, such as the human
middle temporal/medial superior temporal complex (MT1),
responded more strongly when subjects viewed photographs or
silhouettes of animals, people, objects, or natural scenes containing implied motion than when they viewed similar images
that did not imply motion (e.g., a cup falling off a table compared
with a cup resting on a table, or a running athlete compared with
an athlete at rest). These studies demonstrate that implied motion can activate brain areas also known to be engaged by real
image motion.
However, one cannot infer from such studies whether viewing
stimuli with implied motion elicits directional motion signals in
the brain, nor whether the same subsets of neurons, with similar
tunings, are activated for implied and physical visual motion.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging measures net activity,
and does not currently have the resolution to routinely resolve
individual columns. Moreover, although area MT1 has been
shown to carry direction-selective signals in response to visual
motion (Huk & Heeger, 2002; Huk et al., 2001), it can also be

activated by other factors, like attention and arousal (Beauchamp, Cox, & DeYoe, 1997; Corbetta, Miezin, Dobmeyer,
Shulman, & Petersen, 1991; O’Craven, Rosen, Kwong, Treisman, & Savoy, 1997; Saenz, Buracas, & Boynton, 2002), that
may not be directionally selective (Huk et al., 2001). Thus, a net
increase in MT1 activation need not imply the existence of a
direction-selective signal, nor do multiple instances of MT1
activation conﬁrm that the same direction-selective neurons
have been activated repeatedly (Grill-Spector & Malach, 2001;
Huk & Heeger, 2002).
In order to infer whether the same neural circuits are employed by inference and perception in the domain of visual
motion, we made use of a motion aftereffect (MAE) paradigm.
The MAE is a well-studied psychophysical phenomenon (Mather, Verstraten, & Anstis, 1998; Wohlgemuth, 1911) used to
infer and assess the properties of direction-selective neural
mechanisms. Prolonged viewing of motion in one direction
makes subsequently viewed stationary (or directionally ambiguous) patterns appear to move in the opposite direction. This
illusion is believed to result from the adaptation-induced decrease in activity of directionally selective neurons that respond
to the adapted-to direction of motion (Barlow & Hill, 1963;
Mather et al., 1998; Sutherland, 1961). This direction-selective
adaptation in turn causes an imbalance in the population
activity of neurons that represent different directions of motion.

Volume 19—Number 3

Because of this postadaptation imbalance, the neural population code will indicate a net direction of motion opposite the
adapted-to direction when probed with stationary or directionally ambiguous stimuli. Thus, the presence of an MAE can be
used as a psychophysical test for the involvement of directionselective neural mechanisms.
We predicted that if viewing photographs of implied motion
relies on the same direction-selective neurons that are involved
in perception of physical motion, then viewing a series of such
photos depicting motion in the same direction would adapt direction-selective neurons and produce an MAE. We tested this
hypothesis in three experiments in which we measured whether
viewing implied motion in one direction altered the perceived
direction of subsequently presented real motion. In two experiments, the motion implied from the photographs was either
leftward or rightward (Fig. 1a), and in the third experiment, the
implied motion was inward or outward (Fig. 1b).
METHOD

Each experiment began with a baseline motion-sensitivity task
using moving-dot test stimuli. Following the baseline task,
subjects viewed a series of implied-motion photographs interleaved with test trials of moving-dot probes. The dot probes were
used to assess whether or not an MAE resulted from viewing the

implied-motion photos. In the ﬁrst experiment, subjects viewed
pictures with implied motion to the left or to the right and were
tested with dot displays containing leftward or rightward real
motion, making two-alternative forced-choice judgments on the
direction of dot motion (left or right). The second experiment was
similar, except that after 50% of the picture sequences, selected
at random, there was a 3-s delay between the offset of the last
picture and the onset of the moving-dot test trial. This delay was
introduced to test whether an MAE from implied motion, like
MAEs from physical motion (Keck & Pentz, 1977), would decay
during a brief period following adaptation. In the third experiment, mirror-reversed pairs of implied-motion photographs were
shown simultaneously side by side to create implied motion
either toward ﬁxation (‘‘inward’’) or away from ﬁxation (‘‘outward’’). In all three experiments, subjects were instructed to
attend to the pictures for a memory test following the experiment; there were no instructions to imagine or attend to the
motion implied in the photographs. All subjects performed
above chance levels on the old/new recognition memory test at
the end of the experiment.
Participants and Equipment
All subjects (26, 19, and 32 for Experiments 1–3, respectively)
were naive to the purpose of the experiments and were recruited
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology community.
Subjects provided written consent and were paid for participation. They were seated approximately 40 cm away from the
display, a CRT monitor with a resolution of 1024  768 pixels
(26  19.5 cm) and a refresh rate of 75 Hz.
Moving-Dot Test Stimuli
We used a standard moving-dot direction-discrimination task
(Newsome & Pare, 1988), which had previously been employed
as a means to assess and quantify MAEs from adaptation to real
motion (Blake & Hiris, 1993). Random dot displays such as
those used in this task have been important for studying visual
motion systems because they do not contain recognizable features that can be used to infer a change in location over time, and
are thus thought to rely on primary motion-processing mechanisms.
In the ﬁrst two experiments, each test stimulus consisted of
100 dots contained within a rectangular window whose length
and width were 33% of the entire display (approximately 121 
91 of visual angle). We manipulated the proportion of dots moving coherently in a particular direction (motion coherence) from
trial to trial, and subjects were instructed to indicate the direction of global motion using a key press (left or right). On each
frame, a subset of the dots, equal to the percentage of dots
moving coherently for that trial, was selected to move either left
or right. All other dots disappeared and randomly reappeared at
any other location within the test window. A new set of dots was
reselected for coherent movement on each frame, so that the

278

trajectory of single dots could not be followed throughout a trial.
Each 1-s test trial consisted of 25 frames displayed for 40 ms
each. Dot displacement for coherent motion was approximately
0.051 per frame.
In the third experiment, the test stimuli were identical, except
that they consisted of 200 dots, 100 on each side of ﬁxation (instead of 100 total), and they moved horizontally toward or away
from the vertical midline (instead of left or right). By a key-press
response, subjects indicated whether the dots appeared to move
inward or outward. The window of the test stimulus was the same
size as in the ﬁrst two experiments, so the dot density was double.
Baseline Motion Sensitivity
Prior to the adaptation phase of each experiment, subjects were
tested on a baseline motion-calibration task, during which dot
coherence ranged from 5% to 65% over 180 1-s trials consisting
of 25 frames each; motion was either leftward or rightward in the
ﬁrst two experiments, and either inward or outward in the third
experiment. A logistic function was ﬁtted to the responses, with
‘‘leftward’’ or ‘‘outward’’ arbitrarily coded as negative coherence, and ‘‘rightward’’ or ‘‘inward’’ as positive coherence. For
each subject, the amount of coherence corresponding to asymptotic performance (99% ‘‘rightward’’ or ‘‘inward’’ responses
and 1% ‘‘rightward’’ or ‘‘inward’’ responses) was determined
from the ﬁtted logistic function. The average of the absolute
value of these two values was considered the maximal dot coherence for each subject, and deﬁned as 1 unit of normalized
coherence. For each direction of motion, stimuli with 1 unit of
normalized coherence and with 50% and 25% of this coherence
value were used as test stimuli in the adaptation phase of the
experiment. There were thus six different test stimuli per subject; within each block, the different stimuli were repeated an
equal number of times, in random order. Across subjects, the
mean for 1 unit of normalized coherence corresponded to 35%
(SD 5 14%) actual dot coherence.
Adaptation to Implied Motion
The adaptation stimuli were 103 color photographs with either
leftward or rightward implied motion. The photos, found from
Internet searches, depicted people, animals, or vehicles in
motion. No photos contained text, and all photos were mirrorreversed so that they could be used for both directions of adaptation. Each image was centered on the screen, and its size was
scaled to a ﬁxed area of 200,000 pixels (about 1301 squared), with
the original aspect ratio maintained.
In the ﬁrst experiment, the direction of adaptation, left or
right, was constant within a block, and there were 30 adaptation
trials in each of six blocks. Each adaptation trial consisted of a
sequence of pictures lasting either 60 s (1st trial in a block) or 6 s
(other trials) and was followed by a moving-dot test trial (see
Fig. 2). A sequence of pictures was generated by randomly
sampling from the 103 photos without repeat until all photos

Fig. 2. Adaptation procedure. Adaptation consisted of viewing a succession of frozen-motion photographs with implied motion. Following 60 s of adaptation (the ﬁrst trial per block), or 6 s of top-up
adaptation, subjects made forced-choice judgments of the global direction of moving-dot test stimuli
(25 frames presented over 1 s). The direction of adaptation varied randomly across six blocks. In the
second experiment, there was a 3-s delay between the last picture shown on half the adaptation trials
and the moving-dot test trial that came afterward.

were used, so that any picture was equally likely to follow every
other picture. Pictures were shown every 545 ms, so that 110
photos were presented during the initial 60-s adaptation trial of
each block, and 11 photos during each of the 6-s ‘‘top-up’’ adaptation trials. The initial adaptation trial and the 29 top-up
trials in each block differed only in their duration.
The second experiment was identical to the ﬁrst except for the
following differences. There were 36 adaptation trials per block
instead of 30, and on 50% of these trials, there was a 3-s delay
with a blank screen between the last adapting photo and the
onset of the test trial. Also, the presentation rate was 200 ms per
picture, instead of 545 ms.
The adaptation procedure for the third experiment was the
same as the procedure for the ﬁrst experiment, except for the
following differences. The 103 photos from the previous ex-

Volume 19—Number 3

periments were converted to gray scale and scaled to a ﬁxed size
of 512 by 768 pixels. Each picture and its mirror reversal were
presented adjacently, such that the implied motion was either
toward the center (inward) or away from the center (outward).
Subjects were instructed to ﬁxate a small spot (about 11) at the
border of the two images (see Fig. 1b). A pair of photos was
shown every 427 ms, so that 140 pairs were seen during the
initial 60-s adaptation trial and 14 were seen during the twentynine 6-s top-up trials.

Subject Exclusion
We excluded from analysis a small number of subjects who
were likely to be guessing or otherwise unable to perform the
direction-discrimination task. Two subjects from the ﬁrst ex-

periment, 1 subject from the second experiment, and 3 subjects
from the third experiment performed poorly on the baseline
motion-sensitivity task, such that 1 unit of normalized motion
coherence for these subjects would have exceeded 100% dot
coherence. These subjects were excluded from analysis. In the
ﬁrst experiment, 5 subjects’ performance on the dot-discrimination task did not exceed chance. That is, a logistic ﬁt to the
data for these subjects indicated that the likelihood of judging a
test stimulus as moving in a particular direction (right or left) did
not increase signiﬁcantly with increased dot coherence in that
direction. These subjects were also excluded from analysis.

RESULTS

We observed signiﬁcant MAEs in all three experiments. After
viewing implied motion in one direction, subjects were more
likely to see the moving-dot test stimulus moving in the opposite
direction. The population means, plotted in units of dot coherence normalized to each subject’s motion sensitivity (see
Method), showed that the direction of adaptation shifted the
motion response function. This can be seen in Figures 3a
through 3c by comparing for each pair of adapting conditions the
point of perceived null motion, that is, the amount of motion
coherence for which subjects were equally likely to respond
‘‘left’’ or ‘‘right’’ (the ﬁrst two experiments) or ‘‘inward’’ or
‘‘outward’’ (the third experiment). For example, in Figure 3a, the
point of perceived null motion contains more actual leftward
motion coherence in the test stimulus following adaptation to
leftward implied motion than following adaptation to rightward
implied motion, a pattern consistent with an MAE in the direction opposite to the direction of implied-motion adaptation.
In Figures 3a through 3c, the size of the horizontal offset
between paired functions reﬂects the amount of real motion
needed to make a test stimulus presented following one direction
of adaptation perceptually equivalent to a test stimulus presented following the opposite direction of adaptation. To quantify the MAEs across subjects, we ﬁt separate motion response
functions to each subject’s data using logistic regression, and
calculated the mean difference between the points of perceived
null motion in paired adaptation conditions (see Fig. 3d).
In the ﬁrst experiment, the point of perceived null motion
differed by 0.22  0.06 units of normalized motion coherence,
t(18) 5 3.82, p 5 .001, prep 5 .99 (unless otherwise noted, the
signiﬁcance of effects was assessed with two-tailed paired t tests
comparing the location of the point of perceived null motion
within pairs of adapting conditions). In terms of the actual
(nonnormalized) test coherence, the shift in the null point was
8.7  2.5%, t(18) 5 3.48, p 5 .003, prep 5 .97. If viewing implied motion did not lead to adaptation, the motion response
functions would have overlapped, and hence there would have
been no difference between the points of perceived null motion
for rightward and leftward implied motion.

280

The results of the no-delay condition in the second experiment
closely replicated the result of the ﬁrst experiment: The null point
shifted by 0.27  0.09 units of normalized coherence, t(17) 5
6.47, p 5 .000, prep 5 .99, or 8.9  1.9% of actual test coherence,
t(17) 5 4.74, p 5 .000, prep 5 .99. However, with a 3-s delay
between adaptation and test stimuli, the effect of adaptation was
smaller: 0.10  0.06 units of normalized coherence and 2.3 
1.9% of actual coherence. The difference between the no-delay
and delay conditions was signiﬁcant, t(17) 5 2.75, p 5 .013,
prep 5 .94, and t(17) 5 2.24, p 5 .038, prep 5 .90, for normalized
and nonnormalized test coherence, respectively.
Subjects in the third experiment showed signiﬁcant adaptation to inward and outward implied motion. The point of perceived null motion shifted by 0.17  0.04 units of normalized
coherence, t(28) 5 4.98, p 5 .000, prep 5 .99, or 5.7  1.0% of
actual coherence, t(28) 5 5.48, p 5 .000, prep 5 .99.
DISCUSSION

In each of these three experiments, the viewing of photographs
depicting movement led to systematic shifts in the responses to
subsequent real-motion test probes. The test probes were more
likely to be judged as moving in the direction opposite the direction depicted in the previous adapting photographs than to be
moving in the same direction. The transfer of adaptation from
implied motion to real motion provides evidence that still images depicting movement recruit direction-selective neurons,
and demonstrates that processing implied motion can affect the
subsequent perception of real motion.
Our results cannot be explained by low-level motion-energy
biases in the image sequences, or by apparent motion between
successive frames. The sequence of images was generated
randomly on each adaptation trial. There was an equal likelihood that any particular pair of images would be seen in one
order or the opposite order, and this rules out explanations based
on spurious biases in motion energy or apparent motion. Further,
it is unlikely that our results can be explained by systematic eye
movements (e.g., Chaudhuri, 1991). Our use of inward and
outward stimuli in the third experiment preclude explanations
based on optokinetic nystagmus, and the fact that the pattern of
results was the same as in the previous two experiments is evidence against explanations based on directional biases in eye
movements during adaptation.
It also appears unlikely that the results obtained in these
experiments were due to a strategic or cognitive bias, rather than
a shift in the perception of the test stimuli. First, had the pattern
of responses in the ﬁrst experiment been driven by a nonperceptual bias, we would not have predicted the decline in the
MAE after a brief delay, as observed in the second experiment.
Second, a debrieﬁng following the third experiment revealed
that prior knowledge of the MAE did not explain the results: Of
the 24 subjects who responded to a question asking whether or
not they had heard of the MAE (5 subjects did not respond), 20

said they had never heard of it. When forced to guess ‘‘whether
prolonged viewing of upward motion would cause a subsequent
static image to appear to move up or down,’’ 14 of the 24 subjects responded ‘‘up,’’ and 10 responded ‘‘down.’’ The size of the
observed MAE did not differ signiﬁcantly depending on responses to these questions—‘‘had heard’’ versus ‘‘had not heard’’
of the MAE (0.18  0.03 vs. 0.28  .015 units of normalized

Could our results be explained by aftereffects due to active
visual imagery of motion? There is evidence that mental imagery
of motion can activate motion-sensitive brain areas (Goebel,
Khorram-Sefat, Muckli, Hacker, & Singer, 1998; Grossman &
Blake, 2001), and our own unpublished results suggest that
imagery of motion can elicit an MAE. Nonetheless, although this
explanation remains logically possible, it seems unlikely that
subjects actively imagined motion in the experiments reported
here. First, subjects were not instructed to imagine motion nor
given any incentive to do so. Second, active imagery typically

requires from a few hundred milliseconds to several seconds
(Cooper & Shepard, 1973; Kosslyn, 1976), and our stimulus
presentation rates were relatively fast (2–5 Hz).
One might reasonably ask, nonetheless, whether viewing the
photographs elicited direction-selective neural activity via automatic associative processes. We cannot rule this out, nor do we
wish to. Such processes are compatible with Helmholtz’s (1886/
1924) notion of ‘‘unconscious inferences,’’ which have been
postulated to explain a wide range of perceptual phenomena
(e.g., Barlow, 2001). In this view, pictorial cues to motion are
learned from statistical regularities in the environment, such
that static images containing familiar objects in motion can
trigger motion responses via pattern-completion processes.
Recently, by using explicit associative-learning paradigms, it
has been shown that a previously meaningless static cue can,
after training, bias the percept of an ambiguous-motion display
(Qi, Saunders, Stone, & Backus, 2006) and can elicit directional
signals in single neurons in macaque MT (Schlack & Albright,
2007). Moreover, when a moving stimulus repeatedly follows a
predictable trajectory, direction-selective neurons in macaque
parietal cortex signal the direction of that stimulus’s motion
when it is occluded (Assad & Maunsell, 1995).
Our results join a growing number of ﬁndings in the human
and monkey literature showing interactions between form and
motion processing (reviewed by Kourtzi, 2004). One important
observation has been that a very simple type of form information,
orientation, can strongly affect motion perception: Two types of
stimuli that do not contain directional motion but do contain
spatial orientation information, motion streaks (Burr & Ross,
2002; Geisler, 1999) and Glass patterns (Krekelberg, Dannenberg, Hoffmann, Bremmer, & Ross, 2003; Ross, Badcock, &
Hayes, 2000), have been shown to inﬂuence perceptual and
neural visual motion processing. Because of sluggish temporal
integration in the visual system, moving stimuli tend to create
blur along the direction of motion, and the visual system may
exploit this regularity to infer motion trajectories from orientation, including the orientation information in motion streaks and
Glass patterns. We note, however, that the inference of motion
from simple orientation cues and the inference of motion from
high-level object and scene-related cues likely occur at different stages in the processing pathway. Motion streaks may be
extracted quite early in processing (e.g., perhaps in primary
visual cortex; Geisler, 1999). In contrast, inferring the direction
of motion depicted in photographs likely occurs in higher-level
object areas in visual cortex, as evidenced by electroencephalographic (EEG) studies showing a delayed response to impliedmotion photographs (Lorteije et al., 2006), as well as by the
sensitivity to the depiction of action in neurons in anterior regions of the temporal lobe in monkeys (Jellema & Perrett, 2003).
In summary, we found that direction-selective motion adaptation can result from viewing static images with implied motion.
The direction-selective adaptation we report had an effect on
subjects’ perception of a real-motion stimulus immediately fol-

lowing adaptation. These ﬁndings demonstrate that inferring
motion from purely form-based cues involves direction-selective motion mechanisms. Further, these mechanisms must rely
on some of the same neurons used for motion perception because
the adaptation transferred from implied motion to perception of
real motion. That is, at least some neurons that are directionally
selective for the perception of actual motion are also activated
while observers view implied motion in that same direction. A
very recent study has independently arrived at a related conclusion—that viewing real motion can affect the neural response
to subsequent implied-motion photographs—using a physiological measure (EEG) instead of a perceptual measure (Lorteije
et al., 2007). An exciting extension of the work reported here
would be to directly investigate the neural signals involved in
the perception of motion implied in static images.
