In a serial recall task, the Hebb repetition effect occurs when recall performance improves for a sequence
repeated throughout the experimental session. This phenomenon has been replicated many times.
Nevertheless, such cumulative learning seldom leads to perfect recall of the whole sequence, and errors
persist. Here the authors report evidence that there is another side to the Hebb repetition effect that
involves learning errors produced in a repeated sequence. A learning measure based on past recalls
(correct or incorrect) shows that the probability of a given response increases with the number of prior
occurrences of that response. The pattern of results reveals another manifestation of the Hebb repetition
effect and speaks to the nature of implicit learning.

2005; Melton, 1964), words (Sechler & Watkins, 1991), and spatial
objects (Gagnon, Foster, Turcotte, & Jongenelis, 2004; Milner, 1971;
Turcotte, Gagnon, & Poirier, 2005; see Couture & Tremblay, 2006,
for a direct comparison between verbal and spatial Hebb repetition
effects). Finally, participants unaware of the repetition show similar
learning curves to those who become aware of it (Couture & Tremblay, 2006; McKelvie, 1987).
Despite the robustness of the Hebb repetition effect and the
resistance of such incidental learning to interference (see Seger,
1994, for a discussion), there are reports that such cumulative
learning can be modulated and even abolished under some conditions. First, large individual differences are observed, with some
participants not exhibiting a significant learning curve. For instance, McKelvie (1987) found that only 66 participants out of 163
reached a perfect score following 12 repetitions of the sequence,
and mean recall performance for the last repetition was about
seven items out of nine. These results suggest that, even after a
relatively high number of repetitions (up to 12) of the same set of
items, for example, nine digits, learning is far from complete.
Second, there is also some evidence that Hebbian-like sequence
learning can be markedly impaired when auditory distraction is
present (Farley, Neath, Allbritton, & Surprenant, 2007), perceptual
properties of the repeated items are changed (e.g., Hughes &
Jones, 2004), or participants are prevented from responding to the
to-be-remembered sequences (e.g., Cohen & Johansson, 1967;
Cunningham et al., 1984). Finally, there are reports that older
adults do not learn from Hebbian repetitions of a sequence of
spatial items, whereas young adults show the classical learning
curve (e.g., see Turcotte et al., 2005).
The classical method for evaluating recall performance and thus
detecting the Hebb repetition effect is to take into account correct
responses. Scoring is done according to a strict serial recall criterion: A response is considered correct when the right item is
recalled in the same serial position in which it was presented.
However, analyses of errors committed by participants performing
ISR have revealed various types of errors, such as transpositions

In a seminal study in the field of cognitive science, Donald O. Hebb
(1961) used a variant of the verbal immediate serial recall (ISR) task in
which participants heard sequences of nine digits, displayed at a rate of
one item per second, which they then had to reproduce in their order of
presentation. Among a number of different trials, one particular series,
that is, the same digits in the same order, recurred in every third trial.
Contrary to the predictions of his initial theory regarding cell assemblies
(see Hebb, 1949), Hebb (1961) found that ISR improved over repetitions
and above mere task practice. Such cumulative learning occurred for the
repeated series (and not for the novel trials) and is thus assumed to reflect
the formation of an enduring representation of the repeated sequence.
This form of learning is now referred to as the Hebb repetition effect and
constitutes a powerful research paradigm to investigate sequence learning—which is believed by many researchers to be the basis of most
cognitive activities such as language, problem solving, and motor control
(Conrad, 1964; Lashley, 1951; Melton, 1963)—and to explore how
information is consolidated within the human brain (e.g., see Hitch,
Fastame, & Flude, 2005; see also Page, Cumming, Norris, Hitch, &
McNeil, 2006).
There are by now some very well-established features of the Hebb
repetition effect, though the underlying mechanism is still not fully
understood. Learning takes place with up to five novel trials between
repetitions (Melton, 1963, 1964). The Hebb repetition effect is not
restricted by the nature of inputs, as learning appears to be of comparable magnitude for digits (Cohen & Johansson, 1967; Cumming,
Page, & Norris, 2003; Kogo & Koshikawa, 1991; O’Shea & Clegg,

HEBB REPETITION EFFECT AND ERROR LEARNING

(an item recalled in the wrong serial position), repetitions (the
same item recalled more than once in the same trial), intrusions
(items “recalled” that were not actually presented), and protrusions
(items erroneously recalled at the serial position of preceding
sequences; see Henson, 1996; see also Estes, 1991). It has been
observed that some errors recur across trials in ISR tasks. After
introducing a clever way of analyzing the recurrences of such
errors across trials, Estes (1991) concluded that short-term memory is not reset after an experimental trial and that at the time of
recall, representations from the actual trial and those from preceding trials are competing for selection. In short, “recall on a given
trial [is] substantially influenced by events of preceding trials”
(Estes, 1991, p.168). In the Hebb paradigm, given that the repeated
series recurs, representations from that sequence might be reactivated. As suggested by Estes’s (1991) results and interpretation,
these representations might reflect correct recalls as well as errors.
It is therefore possible that sequence learning involves learning
both correct responses and errors.
The study of Turcotte et al. (2005), which explored the effect of
aging on the learning of supraspan sequences of spatial materials,
may be taken to support an error-learning hypothesis. Indeed, this
study revealed that older adults exhibited not only an attenuated
Hebb repetition effect but also a larger proportion of recurring
errors, such as intrusions and protrusions in the visuospatial domain. However, these results were averaged across participants
and trials, and the authors did not provide error analyses for the
verbal Hebb repetition effect. Individual analyses would provide
more information about the relative contribution of error learning.
To better understand the memory processes highlighted by the Hebb
repetition effect and investigate the possibility that errors may be learned,
we adapted the approach used by Estes (1991) to pinpoint the source of
errors in an order reconstruction version of the ISR task. A closed set of
nine letters was used as to-be-remembered material. The total number of
responses was divided into correct and incorrect responses. Errors were
considered as repeated when they were made in the same serial position
on any previous repeated trial (Repetition n ⫺ 1, n ⫺ 2, up to n ⫺ 11) or
as “new” when they were falsely recalled on a given serial position for the
first time.1 We used the classical Hebb procedure: An auditory verbal ISR
task was used in which the same sequence of letters was repeated every
four trials. For the classical Hebb repetition effect, the proportion of
correct responses was calculated separately for each participant, and
individual learning slopes were estimated for the 12 presentations of the
repeated sequence and for the mean of the 12 corresponding blocks of
three nonrepeated trials. A different approach was necessary to study
error learning. It was not possible to simply test for an increase in the
number of repeated errors across the 12 presentations of the critical
sequence. Such an analysis would naturally show an increase in the
recurrence of errors, even in the absence of error learning, because each
new error necessarily increases the subsequent probability to observe a
repeated error. We present an analysis of individual response probabilities
that depends on the number of past occurrences of that response. This
measure provides an indication of correct and incorrect response learning
across the repeated sequences.

Method
Participants
Twenty-four adults from the Université Laval, Québec City,
Québec, Canada, took part in the experiment in exchange for a

525

small honorarium. All participants reported normal or correctedto-normal audition and vision.

Material
The ISR task was programmed with Microsoft Visual Basic
(Version 6.0). At each trial, nine letters were played to the participant through headphones at a rate of one letter per second (700 ms
On, 300 ms Off) at approximately 65 dB(A). The items were
recorded in a French female voice and edited with Sound Forge
(Version 7.0; Sony Corporation, 2003). The same set of monosyllabic letters was used over trials (D, F, G, H, K, L, N, Q, and R);
only the order of presentation changed from trial to trial. After
each sequence, the nine letters were randomly presented horizontally within a 17- ⫻ 17-cm frame on a computer screen, and
participants had to give their responses by using a mouse to click
on the letters. Each letter changed from black to green when
selected and remained that way until the end of the trial.

Design and Procedure
The sequence heard on Trial 4 was presented 12 times during the
experiment, once every four trials. There were three novel randomly
generated sequences between each repetition of the critical sequence,
forming 12 blocks of four trials. Two practice trials preceded the 48
experimental trials (12 repeated sequences and 36 novel sequences).
The critical repeated sequence was randomly chosen for each participant. Participants were told to memorize all the items they heard in
the same order in which they were presented and to try to reproduce
the correct sequence in the recall phase. Participants received no
feedback on their responses. No other instructions were given and, of
course, no cues about the repeating sequences were provided. Participants were tested individually.

Results and Discussion
To study the classical Hebb repetition effect, the proportion of
correct responses for repeated and novel sequences was calculated for
each of the 12 experimental blocks. All items recalled in their correct
serial position were considered correct. We calculated slopes for the
proportion of correct responses across for repeated and nonrepeated
sequences (separately for each participant and then averaged over all
24 participants). Two average learning slopes are compared. One
slope represents the change in proportion of correct responses on
Presentations 1 to 12 of the repeated sequence. The second slope
corresponds to the change in proportion of correct responses for the 12
corresponding blocks of three nonrepeated trials. We observed a Hebb
repetition effect, that is, a sequence repetition learning beyond mere
task practice. Indeed, the averaged learning slope for the repeated
series was 0.15 correct items per repetition and 0.05 correct items for
the novel trials. This difference was significant, t(23) ⫽ 1.99, p ⫽ .05,

Because we used a closed pool of to-be-remembered items (as in most
classical studies; e.g., see Hebb, 1961), the present study is constrained to
the examination of protrusions. These errors refer to the incorrect production of an item from the closed pool of to-be-remembered items at its serial
position of preceding trials (n ⫺ 1 and n ⫺ 2⫹).

New Errors Versus Repeated Errors
Responses not recalled in their proper serial positions were
classified as erroneous responses. The error analysis was restricted
to the 11 last-repeated trials (errors on the first presentation of the
critical list are necessarily new). If a given error was previously
made in the same serial position on any preceding repeated sequence, it was counted as a repeated error. Otherwise, the error
counted as a new error. Figure 1 shows the number of correct
responses and errors made by participants for the repeated series in
the verbal ISR task. On this diagram, errors are decomposed into
new and repeated errors. Repeated errors were further decomposed
into repetitions from the last repeated sequence (n ⫺ 1) or repetitions from an earlier sequence (n ⫺ 2⫹). Estes (1991) showed
that protrusions from the sequence that immediately precedes a list
are a key source of error. Figure 1 suggests that protrusions may
also originate from preceding repeated sequences when using a
Hebb paradigm (interspaced by filler lists). These two types of
protrusions are conceptually distinct and complementary. Only
protrusions from the repeated sequences are considered in the
present study to test whether these errors are subject to a form of
learning that mirrors the classical Hebb repetition effect.
When one uses the Hebb procedure, two forms of learning may
occur across the repeated sequences: One is characterized by an
increasing proportion of correct responses, and one is characterized by
an increasing proportion of repeated errors. The former corresponds to
the classical Hebb sequence learning effect, whereas the latter suggests that learning can also take place for erroneous responses. How-

ever, one has to consider that simply repeating errors does not necessarily indicate that they are learned. Indeed, fixed error probabilities
(with no learning across repetitions) can also explain why errors are
repeated. Repeated errors can be shown to increase simply due to
chance, given constant error probabilities.2 This increase in recurring
errors across the 12 experimental blocks is attributable to the fact that
each new error necessarily increases the probability for subsequent
errors to be classified as repeated rather than new. Therefore, a simple
error repetition analysis does not adequately answer the question of
interest.
If errors are progressively learned across repetitions of the
critical sequence as typically observed for correct responses, then
they should become more probable as a function of the number of
times that they have been produced in previous identical sequences. On the basis of this reasoning, we developed a measure
that can reveal two sides of Hebbian learning. Indeed this measure
applies both to correct responses and errors. The measure and
analysis are proved valid by simulation (i.e., that they do not
falsely indicate error learning when there is none).

We thank an anonymous reviewer for noting the possibility that the
increase in repeated errors and the decrease in new errors could be the
result of an artifact. We are grateful to Stephan Lewandowksy for demonstrating this confound in a MATLAB simulation.

HEBB REPETITION EFFECT AND ERROR LEARNING

A Measure of Response Learning Across Repeated
Sequences
We hypothesize that if learning takes place on the basis of responses made (correct or incorrect), then the probability of producing
a given response should increase as a function of the number of times
the same response had previously been recalled (referred to as the
number of past occurrences). The number of past occurrences indicates the specific number of times that a response is produced at the
same serial position in preceding presentations of the repeated sequence. The key difference between error learning across repeated
sequences and error repetitions due to constant transposition probabilities is that the latter does not predict an increase in error probabilities across the number of past occurrences. Conversely, if a response (correct or incorrect) is repeated without being learned—as
tested in a simulation reported below—its observed probability should
be invariable across those repetitions.
Probabilities were calculated for the nine correct responses (one
for each serial position) and for 16 transposition errors involving
the most common errors in ISR, that is, Serial Position p ⫺ 1 or
p ⫹ 1 transpositions. Each of the nine serial positions was associated with two types of transpositions, p ⫺ 1 or p ⫹ 1, except for
the first and the final serial positions for which only one transposition can occur, p ⫹ 1 for the first serial position or p ⫺ 1 for the
final one. The transpositions considered in the current analysis
were as follows: T1 ⫹ 1, T2 ⫺ 1, T2 ⫹ 1, T3 ⫺ 1, T3 ⫹ 1, T4 ⫺
1, T4 ⫹ 1, T5 ⫺ 1, T5 ⫹ 1, T6 ⫺ 1, T6 ⫹ 1, T7 ⫺ 1, T7 ⫹ 1, T8 ⫺
1, T8 ⫹ 1, T9 ⫺ 1. For instance, a T2 ⫹ 1 transposition involves an
incorrect item recalled on Serial Position 2 that should have been
recalled on Serial Position 3. It is worth noting that errors studied
here are perhaps those that are the most likely to be learned. Other
transpositions (of Serial Position p ⫹ 3 or p ⫺ 3, for example) may
show a weaker learning effect (or interfere less with the production
of a correct response).
For correct responses, probabilities were computed separately
for each serial position. Thus, data from responses with different
probabilities were not aggregated. The analysis involves sorting
responses according to the number of occurrences of that response
in the preceding trials of the repeated sequence. Each time a
response is recalled by a participant (at the relevant serial position), it counts as an occurrence of that response for a specific
repetition (Repetition 1, Repetition 2, and so on). For each repetition, probabilities are calculated by counting the number of
occurrences of a response and dividing it by the number of opportunities. Response opportunities correspond to the number of
presentations of the repeated sequence (those associated with a
same number of past occurrences) in which the response was
produced or could have been produced. The occurrences and
opportunities for each number of past occurrences are pooled
across participants before the probability of each response is
computed. Table 1 shows the responses of a sample participant for
the 12 repetitions of the critical sequence. These data will be used
as an example to show exactly how response probabilities are
calculated for each repetition.
The present analysis requires calculating the probability of a
response for each repetition of that response. For each cell in Table
1, the number of past occurrences can be obtained by counting the
number of previous occurrences of the target response in the cells
above it in the same column. Table 1 shows two examples of this

procedure, one for a correct response (Q at Position 3) and the
other for a transposition error (K at Position 8). These examples
(described below) were chosen randomly from our sample of
participants for illustrative purposes.

Example 1
The first example shows how to calculate the probability of producing the correct response “Q” at Serial Position 3 as a function of
the number of previous occurrences of that response. At the first
presentation of the list, the number of prior occurrences of that
Response Q is 0 (see Column Q in Table 1). In this example, the
number of prior occurrences becomes 1 at the second presentation of
the repeated sequence because there is now 1 occurrence of Response
Q above that cell. This value does not change at the third presentation
because there is still only 1 prior occurrence of Response “Q” (the
occurrence of “Q” at the third presentation does not count as a prior
occurrence). The number of prior occurrences becomes 2 at the fourth
presentation, 3 at the seventh presentation, 4 at the eighth presentation, and so on. The number of occurrences and opportunities of a
response are calculated for Repetitions 1 to 4. There is 1 occurrence
of Response Q among the two cells that have 1 prior occurrence of
that response (those at the second and third presentations of the
repeated sequence; see Column Q in Table 1). For that participant, we
count 1 occurrence and 2 opportunities for producing that response at
Repetition 1. For Repetition 2, there were 3 opportunities (the fourth,
fifth, and sixth presentations) and again only 1 occurrence. Hence, for
Repetition 1 the probability of producing the correct response is 1/2.
For Repetition 2, the probability is 1/3. Using the same logic, for
Repetition 3 the probability is 1/1, and for Repetition 4, the observed
probability is 1/1. The number of occurrences is always either 0 or 1
when based on individual participant data (after a single occurrence,
if there is one, the number of prior occurrences necessarily increases).
To obtain group trends, occurrences and opportunities are pooled
across participants for each number of prior occurrences. For exam-

COUTURE, LAFOND, AND TREMBLAY

528

ple, across all participants, the probability of producing the correct
response at Serial Position 3 when there is 1 prior occurrence (Repetition 1) is obtained by dividing the total of 24 occurrences by the
total of 51 opportunities, giving a probability of .47. For Repetition 4,
the total across participants is 21 occurrences on 26 opportunities,
giving a probability of .81. This means that when this item has been
recalled four times in previous repeated lists, the observed probability
of recalling it again on the next repeated list is .81. For the present
analysis, we only estimated the probabilities for Repetitions 1, 2, 3,
and 4. The trend for each response was then approximated with a
slope.

Example 2
The same procedure was used for each of the 16 errors selected
for the present analysis ( p ⫺ 1 or p ⫹ 1 transpositions). Example
2 shows how to calculate the probability of producing the error
“K” at Serial Position 8 (Transposition T8 ⫺ 1) as a function of the
number of previous occurrences of that response. In Table 1
(Column F), the number of prior occurrences displayed corresponds to the error K, not to the correct response. The number of
prior occurrences in each cell is calculated by counting the number
of Ks in the cells above it (i.e., in the previous presentations of the
repeated sequence). The error K occurred once when the number
of prior occurrences was 1 (Repetition 1) and there was only 1
opportunity. For Repetition 2, there was 1 occurrence on 4 opportunities. Repetition 3 has 1 occurrence of Error K and 3 opportunities. For Repetition 4, there was 1 occurrence and 1 opportunity.
To estimate response probabilities for each repetition, we divided
the total number of occurrences on the total number of opportunities when combined for all 24 participants. For example, transposition T8 ⫺ 1 was actually produced 8 times out of 29 occasions
for Repetition 2, when calculated over all participants (note that if
all 24 participants had repeated that error twice, the total number
of occurrences would have been 24). The estimated probability of
transposition T8 ⫺ 1 for Repetition 2 was .28.
The probabilities for each correct response and transposition, as
a function of the number of past occurrences, are listed in Table 2
and Table 3. For each response, we calculated the slope of the
estimated probabilities for Repetitions 1 to 4. A positive slope
suggests that learning occurred.

Simulation
To show that this measure is valid and not biased in any way, a
simulation was designed to test a null model that assumes that
there is no error learning, only correct repetition learning. For the
error learning analysis, the simulation data can be viewed as a
control group. The simulation also assumes that repetition learning
relates specifically to the production of correct responses. It attempts to replicate the Hebb repetition effect by relying exclusively on a (correct) response-learning mechanism. The basic
probabilities used to generate correct responses and errors (transpositions) are shown in Table 4. These probabilities were chosen
arbitrarily for the purposes of (a) recreating a typical serial position
effect and (b) reproducing a typical trend in error distributions
where transposition probabilities diminish with the number of
serial positions between the error and the correct response. To
simulate correct response learning, a new set of probabilities was
derived for each repetition of the correct response. At each repetition, its probability of being recalled was increased by 9% (which
corresponds to the learning slope for correct responses in the
experiment). The chance of recalling the other possible responses
was reduced by that same percentage (this reduction was distributed evenly across responses). No additional parameters or assumptions were necessary for the simulation. The simulation generated data for 200 fictitious participants. Each simulated
participant performed 12 repeated sequences (there was no point in
simulating the filler lists because they were not part of the analysis). Individual differences were entirely due to random sampling,
as the data were generated with the same underlying probabilities
(those in Table 4). Error repetitions throughout the 12 trials were
necessarily due to chance (not to error learning). This simulation
thus embodies the null hypothesis that no error learning occurs but
that errors are nevertheless repeated due to the usual pattern of
transpositions. The simulated data can then be analyzed in exactly
the same way as the empirical data. If the learning measure is

sound, then response probabilities for the simulated errors should
not increase as a function of the number of prior occurrences of
these errors. However, the same measure should indicate that
correct response probabilities increased across Repetitions 1 to 4,
at a similar rate to that observed in the experiment (increasing by
9% at each repetition).

Results for the Observed and Simulated Data
Mixed analyses of variance were performed on the estimated
probabilities for Repetitions 1 to 4 (see Tables 2 and 3). For the
1.0

experimental data, a significant effect of prior occurrences was
observed for both correct responses, F(3, 32) ⫽ 5.47, p ⬍ .01, d ⫽
1.43 (mean slope ⫽ 0.09), and errors, F(3, 48) ⫽ 9.14, p ⬍ .001,
d ⫽ 1.51 (mean slope ⫽ 0.08). For the simulated data, a significant
effect of prior occurrences was observed for correct responses,
F(3, 32) ⫽ 5.27, p ⬍ .01, d ⫽ 1.41 (mean slope ⫽ 0.09), but not
for errors, F(3, 54) ⫽ 1.48, p ⫽ .23, d ⫽ 0.57 (mean slope ⫽ 0.01).
The analysis of the simulated data indicates that there was no error
learning, showing that the response learning measure does not
falsely indicate a learning effect when there is none.
The key outcome of this analysis is summarized in Figure 2.
This figure shows the observed probability of producing correct
responses and errors as a function of the number of times that they
were previously recalled. The parallel between the two average
slopes suggests that response learning had a similar effect for
correct responses and errors. Figure 3 shows the results of the
simulation, indicating that no error learning occurred and successfully reproducing the classic Hebb repetition effect solely on the
basis of “response learning.”

Conclusion
As predicted, the probability of producing a specific response
increased as a function of the number of times this response was
previously recalled in the repeated series at that same position. The
simulation of a null model showed that this pattern of results is not
attributable to a flaw in the learning measure. Hence, two forms of
learning do seem to take place in our experiment: learning of

correct responses (the classical Hebb repetition effect) and error
learning. Both effects were observed using the same measure.
Results suggest that responses are stored in memory and have a
cumulative effect on the subsequent trials of a repeated series in a
verbal ISR task. We assume that the responses produced have an
effect on stored representations via an implicit learning mechanism
that increases the probability of selecting that response in subsequent trials.
The fact that errors seem to be learned at a comparable rate to
that of correct responses remains quite surprising. We would
expect correct responses to be learned more quickly, as they are
also presented at each repeated trial. In the present analysis, we
only show the learning effect when there are one to four prior
occurrences, as most errors are never repeated more than four
times throughout the 12 trials of the repeated sequence. On the
other hand, correct responses are generally repeated much more
than four times. The repetition effect for correct responses ends up
having a greater impact on performance than errors—which explains why overall performance improves across repetitions despite error learning. Also, whereas the slopes in Figure 2 show that
the repetition effect for error learning is proportional to the one for
correct responses, the impact of error learning on performance
remains smaller in absolute terms.

General Discussion
The present study revealed a key and novel finding with regard
to sequence learning: The Hebb repetition effect involves a gradual

learning process for both correct and incorrect responses. We used
a measure capable of assessing whether learning occurs (or does
not occur) on the basis of previous responses in the repeated series.
The measure appropriately indicated that no learning occurred
under simulated conditions with fixed transposition probabilities.
The very same analysis on the experimental data shows that the
probability of correct responses and transpositions increases with
the number of times that those responses were previously produced. These results basically indicate that people “learn” from
their responses, whether those responses are correct or not. The
current findings suggest that the Hebb repetition effect may take
two forms— error learning and correct response learning over
repetitions—which can be reduced to the notion of response learning.
In an empirical test of the positional model of serial memory
using the Hebb repetition paradigm, Cumming et al. (2003) concluded from their results that “although such positional effects
[e.g., protrusions] are well documented, they appear to be shortlived, not contributing greatly, if at all, to the observed Hebb
effect” (Cumming et al., 2003, p. 58). Such a conclusion does not
fit with our results showing that protrusions might remain “activated” for up to four trials (three novel trials separating each
repetition) and thus lead to error learning.
The concept of error learning may offer a parsimonious explanation for some unresolved issues in ISR. Error learning could
explain why some researchers found the Hebb repetition effect to
be abolished under some conditions in which serial recall was

disrupted, such as when either response production (e.g., Cohen &
Johansson, 1967), rehearsal (e.g., Cunningham et al., 1984) or
perceptual organization (e.g., Hughes & Jones, 2004; O’Shea &
Clegg, 2006; see also Remillard, 2003, in the context of a serial
reaction time task) was disrupted. Under conditions in which
participants are more prone to make errors, the increased contribution of error learning may seem to abolish the classical Hebb
repetition effect (if proportion correct no longer increases with
repetitions).
In relation to the debate on the mechanisms underlying the Hebb
repetition phenomenon, one explanation would be that implicit
learning might essentially depend on response production. What
we observed here is that the responses produced by participants—
correct or incorrect—appear to be of great significance for Hebbian learning. A parallel could be made between the present
findings and the generation effect. Indeed, the generation effect
suggests that at encoding, self-generated items will often be better
remembered than items presented to the participant (e.g., Hirshman & Bjork, 1988; see Mulligan, 2002, for a discussion). Along
the same lines, there is evidence that testing memory per se—that
is, having participants produce responses in addition to recalling
them— enhances long-term retention beyond factors such as intentional memorization and additional study time (see, e.g., Carpenter, Pashler, & Vul, 2006). In this way, Hebb repetition learning of
correct responses and errors, as observed in the present study,
seems to be related to the generation effect and reflects the importance of response production. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out
that the repetition learning effect may also involve information
encoded at some processing stage other than response production.
One key question remains: Why are erroneous responses
learned? According to Estes (1991), the items’ representations
from the actual trial are competing with those from previous events
at the time of response selection. With time, each item representation is distorted in memory, thus reducing the probability this
item produces interference on a given trial. In the Hebb task, the
recurrence of the repeated series could reactivate the representations of the previous repeated trial or trials. If correct responses
were given on this or these trial or trials, the likelihood that the
“correct” representations would be reactivated is higher. Such a
repeated reactivation would help consolidate a memory trace of the
repeated series and then increase the probability of observing the
classical Hebb repetition effect (see also Hebb, 1961; Melton,
1963, for a similar interpretation). However, if errors were committed on previous repeated trials, the representations of the repeated sequence items might have been altered. Therefore, on a
subsequent repetition, the memory trace would increase the probability of producing that erroneous response. At a speculative
level, the propensity to “learn” errors might reflect some properties
of the implicit memory device, as awareness does not appear to
influence learning in the Hebb task (Couture & Tremblay, 2006;
McKelvie, 1987). Such a system would be adaptive, given that it
memorizes all the information potentially useful to guide behaviors (Reber, 1993), yet rigid, as all will be learned, whether the
information is correct or not. In this way, incidental learning
appears like a blind memory system.
The Hebb repetition effect has been extensively used as a
privileged tool for investigating human memory and is now considered by many researchers to be a benchmark against which
memory models for serial order can be tested (e.g., Cumming et

531

al., 2003; Hitch et al., 2005; Page et al., 2006). The concept of
error learning constitutes an important new issue for studies on
human memory, theoretical models of serial recall, and conceptualizations of implicit memory.
