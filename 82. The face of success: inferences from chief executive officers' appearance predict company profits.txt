The Face of Success
Inferences From Chief Executive Officers’ Appearance
Predict Company Profits

First impressions are powerful and rich sources of information
about other people, and studies have demonstrated that they
predict performance in numerous domains, such as teaching
(Ambady & Rosenthal, 1993) and electoral success (Todorov,
Mandisodza, Goren, & Hall, 2005). Much of this work, however,
has employed outcome variables that are subjective. For example,
in the study of teacher effectiveness, both the predictor (naive
observers’ ratings) and the outcome (teaching evaluations) were
based on subjective opinions. Similarly, electoral success is based
on voters’ impressions of candidates, which are also responsible
for which candidates are elected. In the current study, we examined the relation between a subjective predictor and an objective
performance outcome: Are impressions of chief executive officers
(CEOs) related to the performance of their companies?
Despite the ubiquitous perception of the CEO as the embodiment of a company, there is no clear evidence of any relation
between CEOs’ personalities and their companies’success (Ranft,
Zinko, Ferris, & Buckley, 2006). Although some studies show that
mediating factors, such as environmental context, can link factors
like CEOs’ charisma to companies’ performance, no direct relation between CEOs’ personalities and companies’ success has
been found (Agle, Nagarajan, Sonnenfeld, & Srinivasan, 2006;
Tosi, Misangyi, Fanelli, Waldman, & Yammarino, 2004).
Previous research, however, has shown that personality traits
associated with the evaluation of leadership overlap with traits
that can be judged reliably from the face. These traits include
competence, likeability, and trustworthiness (Todorov et al.,
2005) and dominance (Hess, Adams, & Kleck, 2005). Another
facial feature related to judgments of leadership is facial maturity
(Zebrowitz & Montepare, 2005). Are these variables that can be
gauged from facial information also associated with leaders’
success and performance? To answer this question, we asked
participants to make naive personality judgments from the photographs of the CEOs from the 25 highest and 25 lowest ranked

companies of the Fortune 1,000 and examined whether these judgments related to measures of the companies’ financial success.
METHOD

Stimuli
We selected the 25 highest and 25 lowest ranked companies
from the 2006 listing on the Fortune 500 Web site (http://money.
cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500). The information on
this Web site included the companies’ Web addresses, which we
used to obtain a photograph of each company’s CEO.1 Each
image was cropped tightly around the CEO’s head to remove all
extrafacial information, was converted to gray scale, and was
standardized in size. From the Fortune Web site, we also obtained information about each company’s financial performance
(revenues and profits) for fiscal year (FY) 2005, the year on
which the 2006 Fortune listing was based, as well as for the
previous and following years (FY 2004 and FY 2006). In cases in
which Fortune did not list the information, revenues and profits
were obtained from Google Finance (http://finance.google.com) or
the companies’ annual reports. Two companies were acquired by
other companies during FY 2006 and were excluded from the
analysis. Revenues and profits from FY 2004 through FY 2006
showed high consistency, mean rrevenues(45) 5 .99 and mean
rprofits(45) 5 .93.
Procedure
One hundred undergraduates (ages 18–22; 65 female, 35 male)
received credit in an introductory psychology class for making
either trait ratings (n 5 50) or global assessments of leadership
ability (i.e., ‘‘How good would this person be at leading a company?’’ n 5 50), using 7-point scales. In the trait condition, five
personality traits—competence, dominance, likeability, facial
maturity, and trustworthiness—were rated in separate, randomly ordered blocks. Within each block, the faces were

Only one CEO was female, and she was excluded to preserve homogeneity in
the targets to be rated.

presented in random order using Medialab. Three participants
recognized CEOs, and their data were removed.

Control Variables
As attractiveness affects judgments of appearance (Langlois et al.,
2000), we asked another group of participants (n 5 34; 18 female,
16 male) to use a 7-point scale to rate the faces on attractiveness.
Also, four naive research assistants coded each photo for affect,
again using a 7-point scale (interrater reliability, measured by
the Spearman-Brown r, was .903). Finally, to control for differences
in age that might affect perceptions of the CEOs’ appearance, we
obtained each CEO’s age from Google Finance (http://finance.
google.com).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Trait and leadership ratings were averaged across participants
for each CEO. Data for one CEO were removed from analysis
because his score was more than 3 standard deviations below the
mean for all CEOs. For the five personality traits, we conducted
a principal components analysis with varimax rotation and
obtained two factors: Power (competence, dominance, and facial
maturity; 47% variance explained) and Warmth (likeability and
trustworthiness; 39% variance explained). Hence, for each CEO,
we computed composite power and warmth scores by averaging
the scores for the traits loading on each factor.
We then calculated partial correlations between the independent measures (power scores, warmth scores, and leadership
scores) and dependent measures (mean company revenues for
FY 2004–2006 and mean company profits for FY 2004–2006),
controlling for attractiveness, affective expression, and age.
Table 1 summarizes the results.
Ratings of power-related traits from CEOs’ faces, after controlling for age, affect, and attractiveness, were significantly
related to company profits, r(41) 5 .36, p < .025. Thus, some
element of financial success seems to be communicated through

facial appearance. Further, ratings of CEO leadership were also
strongly related to company profits, r(41) 5 .30, p < .05; however, power and leadership were not significantly related to one
another, r(41) 5 .08, p 5 .60. Similarly, the relation between
profits and leadership remained significant after controlling for
power, r(40) 5 .36, p < .025, and the relation between profits
and power remained significant after controlling for leadership,
r(40) 5 .40, p < .01.2 Thus, participants’ naive perceptions of
leadership ability from CEOs’ faces are significantly related to
how much profit those CEOs’ companies make. Moreover, these
judgments of leadership are not related to judgments of perceived power.
These findings suggest that naive judgments may provide
more accurate assessments of individuals than well-informed
judgments can. Our results are particularly striking given the
uniformity in the CEOs’ appearances. All the CEOs were male,
of approximately the same age, and ostensibly Caucasian. Even
when we controlled for age, affect, and attractiveness, CEOs
from more versus less successful companies could be distinguished via naive judgments based solely on perceptions of the
CEOs’ facial appearance. Of course, we cannot draw any causal
inferences as to whether more successful companies choose
individuals with a particular appearance to be their CEOs or
whether individuals with a particular appearance emerge as
more successful in their work as CEOs. We can conclude,
however, that naive inferences from facial appearance may
provide information not only about subjective preference, but
also about objective performance.

We found no significant relations between participants’ ratings and CEOs’
annual compensation.
